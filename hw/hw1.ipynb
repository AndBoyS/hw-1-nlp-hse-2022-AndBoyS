    "*deadline*: 14 ноября 2022, 23:59\n",
    "\n",
    "В этом домашнем задании вы будете работать с корпусом Harry Potter and the Action Prediction Challenge. Корпус собран из фанфиков о Гарри Поттере и состоит из двух частей: 1) сырые тексты, 2) фрагменты текстов, описывающих ситуацию, в которой произнесено заклинание.\n",
    "\n",
    "Корпус описан в статье: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11037.pdf\n",
    "\n",
    "David Vilares and Carlos Gómez-Rodríguez. Harry Potter and the Action Prediction Challenge from Natural Language. 2019 Annual Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics. To appear.\n",
    "\n",
    "Код для сбора корпуса находится в репозитории: https://github.com/aghie/hpac . Корпус можно скачать по инструкции из этого репозитория, но для экономии времени авторы задания уже скачали и подготовили данные к работе. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ссылки на собранный корпус: \n",
    "* Сырые тексты:  https://www.dropbox.com/s/23xet9kvbqna1qs/hpac_raw.zip?dl=0\n",
    "* Токенизированные тексты в нижнем регистре: https://www.dropbox.com/s/gwfgmomdbetvdye/hpac_lower_tokenized.zip?dl=0\n",
    "* train-test-dev: https://www.dropbox.com/s/3vdz0mouvex8abd/hpac_splits.zip?dl=0\n",
    "\n",
    "Части 1, 2 задания должны быть выполнены на полных текстах (сырых или предобработанных -- на ваше усмотрение), Часть 3 – на разбиение на тестовое, отладочное и обучающее множества. Тестовое множество должно быть использовано исключительно для тестирования моделей, обучающее и отладочное – для выбора модели и параметров. \n",
    "\n",
    "В статье и репозитории вы найдете идеи, которые помогут вам выполнить домашнее задание. Их стоит воспринимать как руководство к действию, и не стоит их копировать и переиспользовать. Обученные модели использовать не нужно, код для их обучения можно использовать как подсказку. \n",
    "\n",
    "## ПРАВИЛА\n",
    "1. Домашнее задание выполняется в группе до 3-х человек.\n",
    "2. Домашнее задание оформляется в виде отчета либо в .pdf файле, либо ipython-тетрадке. \n",
    "3. Отчет должен содержать: нумерацию заданий и пунктов, которые вы выполнили, код решения, и понятное пошаговое описание того, что вы сделали. Отчет должен быть написан в академическом стиле, без излишнего использования сленга и с соблюдением норм русского языка.\n",
    "4. Не стоит копировать фрагменты лекций, статей и Википедии в ваш отчет.\n",
    "5. Отчеты, состоящие исключительно из кода, не будут проверены и будут автоматически оценены нулевой оценкой.\n",
    "6. Плагиат и любое недобросоветсное цитирование приводит к обнуление оценки. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Часть 1. [2 балла] Эксплоративный анализ \n",
    "1. Найдите топ-1000 слов по частоте без учета стоп-слов.\n",
    "2. Найдите топ-10 по частоте: имен, пар имя + фамилия, пар вида ''профессор'' + имя / фамилия. \n",
    "\n",
    "[бонус] Постройте тематическую модель по корпусу HPAC.\n",
    "\n",
    "[бонус] Найдите еще что-то интересное в корпусе (что-то специфичное для фанфиков или фентези-тематики)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Часть 2. [2 балла] Модели представления слов \n",
    "Обучите модель представления слов (word2vec, GloVe, fastText или любую другую) на материале корпуса HPAC.\n",
    "1. Продемонстрируйте, как работает поиск синонимов, ассоциаций, лишних слов в обученной модели. \n",
    "2. Визуализируйте топ-1000 слов по частоте без учета стоп-слов (п. 1.1) с помощью TSNE или UMAP (https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Часть 3. [5 баллов] Классификация текстов\n",
    "Задача классификации формулируется так: данный фрагмент фанфика описывают какую-то ситуацию, которая предшествует произнесению заклинания. Требуется по тексту предсказать, какое именно заклинание будет произнесено. Таким образом, заклинание - это фактически метка класса. Основная мера качества – macro $F_1$.\n",
    "Обучите несколько классификаторов и сравните их между собой. Оцените качество классификаторов на частых и редких классах. Какие классы чаще всего оказываются перепутаны? Связаны ли ошибки со смыслом заклинаний?\n",
    "\n",
    "Используйте фрагменты из множества train для обучения, из множества dev для отладки, из множества test – для тестирования и получения итоговых результатов. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. [1 балл] Используйте fastText в качестве baseline-классификатора.\n",
    "2. [2 балла] Используйте сверточные  или реккурентные сети в качестве более продвинутого классификатора. Поэкспериментируйте с количеством и размерностью фильтров, используйте разные размеры окон, попробуйте использовать $k$-max pooling. \n",
    "3. [2 балла] Попробуйте расширить обучающее множество за счет аугментации данных. Если вам понадобится словарь синонимов, можно использовать WordNet (ниже вы найдете примеры).\n",
    "\n",
    "[бонус] Используйте результат max pooling'а как эмбеддинг входного текста. Визуализируйте эмбеддинги 500-1000 предложений из обучающего множества и изучите свойства получившегося пространства.\n",
    "\n",
    "[бонус] Используйте ваш любимый классификатор и любые (честные) способы повышения качества классификации и получите macro $F_1$ больше 0.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Часть 4. [1 балл] Итоги\n",
    "Напишите краткое резюме проделанной работы. Читали ли вы сами Гарри Поттера или фанфики о нем и помогло ли вам знание предметной области в выполнении домашнего задания?"

waiting for him in gryffindor tower  and wondering whether kreacher might bring him a sandwich there   i ve had enough trouble for a lifetime   as soon as they left dumbledore s office  the exertions of the past day caught up with him  it seemed impossible that only this morning he d been at shell cottage  he was so tired he hardly knew how he got to gryffindor tower  the fat lady was elsewhere  but the portrait hole was swinging open in any case  he wondered what had happened  and then decided that he was too tired to care  he parted company from ron and hermione -LRB- who had  for some impenetrable reason had elected to stay downstairs a while -RRB- and staggered up the spiral stairs  collapsing onto his bed at the top without undressing  he knew he d been gone all year  but it was still his bed  he was still a gryffindor  after all  harry took off his glasses without bothering to open his eyes and placed them on his bedside table  indistinct noises came up the stairs until he shut the door with his wand  there were some things he did nt want to know  after a while  ron came up and also collapsed   well   ron said   we won    yeah   said harry  weariness washing over him   we won   and as unconsciousness took him  the only emotion he felt was that of tired joy  the joy of success  harry woke slowly -- with small bits of his dream merging into reality  when he fully awoke  he saw that he d been asleep for a long time  the shadows were short and the dormitory was deserted  it must be nearly noon  he got up and dressed on automatic  then walked down the stairs to the common room  which  as he had suspected  was almost empty  hermione and ron were nt there  he felt drained  not physically  but emotionally  and when you think about it  it gets worse he berated himself silently  so do nt think about it  but he could nt stop thinking about it  he saw  through the medium of memory  voldemort trying to kill him for the third time  using the killing curse for the third time  saw him fail  for the third time  he saw voldemort watch as the green light  yet again turned on him  saw him fall under the terrible weight of it  and just as he was beginning to think he should throw himself out the window  and was staring at it  he suddenly found himself staring instead into a pair of beautiful  brown eyes   wake up   yelled a voice in his ear  and he turned from ginny  the owner of the eyes  and saw ron   you ve been asleep for hours  now you re awake  and going comatose  come on  you need food   harry almost agreed  now he came to notice it  his stomach was growling so loudly he thought they could hear it down in the great hall  but ginny was right here   i ll come down and meet you in a bit  ok   ron surveyed him  hermione surveyed ginny  and then both nodded  harry and ginny watched them leave  harry looked back at ginny  ginny looked back at harry  harry cast around for something to say and hit on the events of last night  but now he came to it  there was only one thing he thought ginny would want to discuss about it   i was there when fred  you know   he looked up at ginny  and saw tears pouring down her cheeks   yeah   she whispered   i know    ah  gin   he really did nt like seeing her cry  he got up from his chair and held her until her tears subsided  then sat down again  pulling her down with him   yeah   she repeated   percy went after the rookwood  the guy who did it  you know    yeah  he did   said harry  remembering percy s charge   did he catch him   ginny smiled a bit   yes  he did  he got him  stunned him  and he says he wished he d done more  but he could nt  because macnair was after him  he got macnair  too   harry smiled at this  percy  the fussy  boring head boy interested in cauldron bottoms had floored at least two death eaters   did he get any other s   harry wondered aloud   yeah  he got everyone in that group    wow    yeah  wow  i do nt even know where he learnt half the curses he used    huh  what were the effects    well  you saw hat one he used on the minister  right   ginny got up off his knee and sat on the arm of his chair   yep    lucky you  i did nt  but he used another one on macnair that made him stick his leg right up until it touched his ear  and another one that hung a guy upside down by his ankle    yeah  i know that one  levicorpus    ha  yes  ron told me you used it on him once   harry was having fun  they were chatting easily  but  his stomach rumbled again  loud enough for ginny to hear it  she looked at him in amusement   you re hungry   harry winced from the hunger pains   yeah  but the ministry ll be waiting for me down there  and i do nt want to face them  so will the prophet  and a thousand other people  and i do nt want to see any of them   he looked at ginny beseechingly   reckon you could get enough for two and meet me back up here   ginny smiled again   sure   ten minutes later  ginny came back up with a basketful of food   ron and hermione are sitting very close together  she said  grinning  as she set it down   and you were right -- kingsley was down there  and so were a couple of people from the prophet  luna s dad was there  mcgonagall  the malfoys  all my family  about half the wizarding world was waiting for you to show up   after a superb lunch  harry  ron  hermione and ginny adjourned to the grounds  someone had cleared the bodies away  and even the grass was green again  in the patches where it could still grow  there were many where it never would again  it was a beautiful sunny day  the sky was a clear blue and the heat was unrelenting  as if the day s weather were trying to make people forget what had happened last night  they all sat down next to the lake  harry noticed that hermione and ron were sitting very close together  ginny was looking at him  out of the corner of his eye  he saw ron take hermione s hand  but he just kept looking at ginny  drinking her in with his eyes   oi  harry  me and hermione are going inside  ok   called ron  breaking into his thoughts  hermione must ve whispered to him thought harry  ron could never have been accused of being tactful    ok  bye   he called to their retreating figures  and then it was just him and ginny  they sat together  looking out over the lake  harry tried to think of something to say  but still  ho could only settle on last night  so that s what they talked about  harry recounted his story  and ginny recounted hers  tears were shed  when harry reached fred s death  when he remembered seeing remus and dora stretched out together  eternally at peace   and that means you re godfather now  does nt it   said ginny  harry started  he had forgotten   yeah  i am  i d forgotten he asked   they concluded their stories  and sat in silence  harry reached out for her hand  and found it  he held it tight   ginny    yeah    you missed me this year   ginny leant into him   more than anything on god s good earth  harry potter   harry sighed with happiness   i love you  gin   he said  and kissed her ',\n        'it s quite simple   you may look but you may not touch albus  left and right hands  this is all just a bit of silliness  and i say this now  if you don  t like it don  t read it or review it  i  m so sick of people that review something they hated  the order queen and her princess  i ca nt believe you talked me into this   kingsley sighed  he was entering grimmuald place with none other than kenneth ramsfield and his son rupert  kenneth was the keeper to the london lions and a notorious playwizard  he was a great womanizer and only ever dated women ages 18 to 66  it was terrible  his son rupert was one in training  he was an auror and was learning all there was to learn from his father   come one shakelbolt we re good people that just want to help the winning team   kenneth grinned in his rich voice   and it has nothing to do with the women   kingsley mocked   maybe a little   rupert chuckled  kingsley rolled his eyes heaven ward asking for strength as he entered the kitchen  when the door opened the other assembled order members looked up to see sixty-nine year old kenneth ramsfield and his forty-four year old son rupert enter with kingsley shakelbolt  kenneth was tall with a broad muscular figure and short golden hair with hazel eyes  he wore maroon robes  his son was also tall but with lean muscles  his hair went to his shoulder and was held in a ponytail at the nape of his neck  it was blonde  he had a scraggy beard and blue eyes wearing blue robes that made his eyes pop  as soon as they entered kingsley quickly left them and went to stand by sirius  remus  and alastor   what the bloody hell are they doing here   moody growled   rupert cornered me today at work   kingsley sighed   i just thought maybe we could let them see one or two and then obliviate them    yeah and what do you plan to do with minerva  i bet you anything they ll go after her   moody stated   surely not  i mean  she  well she s a    she s a very gorgeous woman that no one outside of this order knows is married   remus stated   and if you ll excuse me i should go rescue my girlfriend   he added walking over to tonks and wrapping his arms around her kissing her cheek  sirius and the others saw rupert s face deflate before walking off  they chuckled at the man just as the fire came to life and in step one of the loveliest yet eccentric creatures to date  moody saw kenneth and rupert s mouths immediately water  the woman of twenty-one was tall with smooth legs that went on for miles  her skin had the perfect porcelain coloring to it and was completely scar or blemish free  her lips were as red as the most perfect red rose and her hair was blacker than night  it was in luscious curls that fell to her middle back and shimmer in the light  her eyes were green slits like a cat s and her curves were phenomenal though she was slim  she had a rather large set of breasts  she was going around the room shaking and dancing as she listened to the music coming from her i-pod  she had a yellow scarf in her hair and was wearing black leather paints with a royal purple long sleeved shirt and a short red half jacket  she was just dancing by the two men when they grabbed her   kingsley my dear friend who is this delectable morsel   kenneth shouted  everyone turned and several looked nervous as they saw the girl s eyes glow before it stopped and she smiled a brilliant white smile  her canine s looked slightly sharper than normal   uh kenneth  rupert this is asphodel raven  also known as cobra   kingsley introduced with a strained expression   well she is the most gorgeous creature i ve seen  why have you not told us about her   kenneth asked as he put the girl on his arm and walked off  it was in that moment that minerva mcgonagall flew in with a man of twenty-one that was tan  tall  and with lean muscle  his hair was get black that he had gelled in a stylish way and his eyes were a green grey  he was wearing tight girl looking blue jeans with a pink button down shirt and grey vest that he paired with black jewelry  he was handsome but it was extremely clear what side of the field he played for   you would have to be the voluptuous and spicy minerva mcgonagall   rupert grinned kissing the woman s hand and wrapping it around his arm  she rose and eyebrow at him and looked up to see cobra on the arm of a very much older men listening to him drawn on about himself   yes i would have to be   minerva said through gritted teeth  molly watched all of this with a twinge of anger and apprehension  she dreaded what would happen when albus appeared   should be a good show eh molly   the young man with the jewelry grinned leaning on the counter she was chopping vegetables on   what are you talking about will   molly sighed though she knew very well   uncle s temper tantrum  he s not sane with my dearest aunt and cousin are concerned  i m betting he looses it big time  even after my cousin   william laughed  on cue albus entered and the meeting began  if the headmaster thought it strange his best spy and deputy had strange men on their arms  one vastly younger and one vastly older he said nothing                                        asphodel esmeralda raven was named for a deadly plant  she lived up to her name she was proud to say it but today she hated being good  she d give anything to put the old man and his pretentious son in their places  listening to them talk about how great they were and how they d love to have them  as she contemplated the best way to kill the  rats for lack of a better word  as she contemplated this she felt a warm flow of magic wrap itself around her and calm her  she looked up and saw albus dumbledore staring at her   asphodel would you care to report   albus asked   nothing much to say sir  but i suggest hogwarts be on its toes when your new professor arrives   pink is not a good color for the school   she stated   thank you my dear   albus nodded   with that i close this meeting   everyone began dispersing for a few moments before supper as the children came in and asphodel grabbed a spot in between moody and black   oh i wish i was not so inclined to do as my father always tells me too   the girl swore   did you realize that your mother and father have the same age difference as you and kenneth   black smirked   not funny   asphodel growled   hey dellie   william called waving her over to where he  rupert  tonks  and remus where   i m going in   asphodel sighed dramatically as she headed over  she walked over to the group smiling   what s up   she asked   see remus just look at her  she runs three miles a day and she still keeps the puppies in their place  she s just like her mother   william grinned putting his hands over his cousin s breasts   yeah and if you were anyone else you d be paralyzed from touching those   remus laughed with his arm around tonks   not really you could touch them i m sure   will laughed  rupert had a hungry look in his eyes staring at the girl s chest   eyes up mr ramsfield   asphodel sighed   see i told you  she s just like her mother   william laughed wrapping his arms around asphodel and kissing her neck   who is   minerva asked   i am apparently like my mother   asphodel grinned   in the looks department    well you have her legs and um   other parts   william smirked pulling his lightweight cousin off her feet   i do not want to know how you know that   remus shuddered   you see a lot when you walk in on a dress sess   he was silenced my asphodel s hand on his mouth   kids say the dernedest things do nt they   she smiled  molly called dinner just then so the uncomfortable conversation stopped  william placed asphodel in her customary seat to albus  left just as kenneth took albus  seat and rupert sat to the girl s left  minerva took her seat and the two women shared a distressed look with each other as albus stood over kenneth  both women looked at him imploringly but he merely went down the table and sat in between remus and sirius   so tell me asphodel dearest love have you ever had a man   rupert asked dipping the girl s plate   that is none of your concern sir   asphodel stated standing  she took her plate and left the room stating something about it being to stuffy in the room                                        no fun being a sex kitten is it   sirius laughed as he came into the sitting room  he found asphodel lying on her stomach on the floor looking at the fire   especially with those sleaze balls   asphodel sighed   i can only imagine what your mother is thinking   sirius laughed   i assure you she s thinking the same thing as me    what the bloody hell    asphodel said laughing  sirius laughed with her as he sat on the floor  the two good friends spent the rest of the time in the sitting room conversing with each other and she left before rupert and kenneth good get to her  a week later asphodel floo to the order meeting and again as she saw the two men   asphodel you foxy little minx   kenneth grinned bringing her into a kiss  a gasp went around the room and something hit the floor shattering  everyone could see that her eyes were open and glowing brightly  a bright light flashed from her and the man was thrown into a wall   do nt ever touch me   she snapped as she hurried to the men in the corner  they all engulfed her into their circle like a swarm of bees or ants protecting the queen  rupert helped his father up and kenneth grinned   i like them spicy   rupert laughed as minerva and albus entered   minerva over here   kingsley stated as he walked up and swept the professor away into the group that had asphodel was in  albus raised an eyebrow at how everyone was surrounding the professor and her child like a secret service protecting the queen and princess but said nothing and walked over to chat with the students who were getting to stay for this meeting  it was nt a big one   have i missed something   albus asked   the troops are protecting their majesties  del flooed in and that ramsfield man  the old one  snogged her   ron stated   what   albus blinked   yeah and then all the order men swept her up over there and they grabbed professor mcgonagall before either could do anything with her   george nodded   dumbledore old man how is everything   kenneth asked as he and his son came over  they could nt get to the two women so they d figure they wait   i ve been better   the professor mumbled   that little tart will scream very well soon   kenneth said not realize who he was talking with   look at that a foot right in the mouth   fred whispered   she s flexible i m sure being the youngest multi-animagus  and that rack is something   rupert stated   matching father and son feet in mouth   harry whispered   of course i bet minerva and asphodel both need a good shag the way they act  my son and i will have them relaxed and craving us by the end of the day   kenneth stated and rupert grinned   i did nt think it possible but you can put two feet in your mouth   george replied and the others laughed but their amusement was silenced when kenneth was knocked in the jaw and went down hard  rupert tried to defend his father but he was punched in the gut and before either man knew what happened they were raised in the air and dumped like a pile of bricks that hit the ground with sickening crunches   touch my wife and child again and i wo nt be so nice   albus said calmly as he strolled over to the group  they parted like the red sea as he swept asphodel in a hug and kissed her head   daddy you re always my hero   she smiled with child innocence  he grinned and placed her down as minerva looked at him with her infamous glare   feel like a big man now do nt you   she stated   only if you were turned on   he stated   of course i was   she smiled as he enveloped her in a loving and passionate kiss   now that is awesome  and the best part is mum s expecting again   asphodel stated   what   albus blinked breaking the kiss much to minerva s displeasure   yep  oh i thought  oops sorry mum   asphodel stated   its fine dearest   minerva stated and looked at the order members   can i get some cover please    our pleasure minerva   several people stated as they turned their backs to the couple and closed around them again   as you see it s clear you re not wanted   moody stated   but i  we  how were we supposed to know   rupert stated standing holding his broken arm gingerly   oh come on it s obvious del and aunt minerva look just alike and seriously if you did nt notice how they look at albus you two need glasses   william stated   so ta-ta and good bye   william smiled as he obliviated them and pushed them out   willie you are my gay hero   asphodel stated jumping into his arms   oh good i m moving up on the list   william laughed   you guys are nuts   ron sighed and everyone laughed as the floo came to life and they realized minerva and albus left   who wants chocolate   asphodel asked conjuring brownies  the end',\n        'i own none of this  jo rowling does  --------  remmy  i m bored   sighed sirius   shh  i m reading   was remus  reply  sirius stood up from where he was sitting and walked over to the crackling fireplace  the common room was quiet   that was until sirius had conjured a wireless radio  music blasted from it  it was the song  right round  by flo rida  now  as this was seventh year at hogwarts for the marauders  radios were nt invented yet  neither was the song sirius was now dancing to  -LRB- but that did nt matter  the author wanted it that way  -RRB-  you spin me right round baby  right round   sirius was singing loudly  dancing like an idiot   sirius   remus shouted   whaaaaaaaaat   sirius said  he was quite angry that remus had ruined his dance   would you do that somewhere else   remus asked   fine   sirius snatched up the radio and left the common room  slamming the portrait hole on his way out  0o0o0o0o0  sirius stop it   james yelled  glaring at sirius from across the entrance hall  where he stood with lily   nope   sirius started dancing to  right round  again   sirius black   lily had walked up to him  her wand out and pointed at his forehead   geez  fine   sirius grabbed up the wireless  carrying it out of the entrance hall  0o0o0o0o0  you spin my head right round   sirius sang  dancing like an idiot  again   what are you doing  sirius   peter asked  walking past sirius in a corridor filled with giggling girls   what does it look like  wormy  i m dancing   and with that  sirius did a back flip in midair   sirius  you re annoying me  please stop it   arthur weasley shouted  he was wearing his prefect badge and everything   stupid prat   sirius thought  grabbing up the wireless again and striding away  0o0o0o0o0    sirius tried tuning the radio  but it would nt come on  that was until he turned the dial just right and that stupid high pitched barbie girl song turned on  sirius groaned  he stood outside dumbledore s office  no one bothered him here  he waited for the song to be over  that was until    i m a barbie girl  in a barbie wo-o-orld  life in plastic  it s fantastic   dumbledore burst out of his office  singing and dancing  sirius thought he was nt the idiot anymore  and wow  he was nt bored  when the song had ended  dumbledore walked back into his office  like nothing had happened  sirius picked up the wireless and headed back to the common room  0o0o0o0o0   and then he bursts out of his office and starts singing  and you thought i was mad   sirius said  a smirk placed upon his face   how do i know you re not lying   remus asked  eyebrows raised   he s not lying   james said from a corner  he pulled out a camcorder and handed it to remus    james where d you get a camcorder with high definition  it s 1977 and i do nt think these ve been invented yet   remus stated  taking it from james   just shut up and watch the damn video   said james  remus pressed the little play button  on the screen appeared sirius  walking to dumbledore s office and sitting the wireless on the floor  there was a cut-scene  then there was dumbledore  dancing and singing  remus let out a laugh   come on  remmy  it s funny  laugh more   james said  laughing as he watched the video   what i do nt get is   why is sirius in the background doing all the moves dumbledore s doing  i mean   sirius hates the barbie girl song    remus said  now laughing   what   sirius ran over and looked at the video  sure enough  though he had nt noticed himself doing it at the time  he was dancing over in a corner beside the radio   i m going to keep this for my kids   james said  laughing   who says you ll have kids   sirius said  glaring at james   you wo nt be able to have kids after this  i highly doubt it    ow   james howled with pain  clutching his crotch  sirius had kicked him right in the --  quit laughing at me  it hurts   sirius laughed in a bark-like way  remus could nt help but fall out of the seat he had been sitting in  and lily had just walked in to witness the whole thing  then she burst into laughter  tears running down her eyes   you still bored  sirius   remus asked from his spot on the floor   not the slightest  moony   sirius grinned  turned on the radio  and started to dance again  remus  james  lily  and peter -LRB- who had been sitting in a corner -RRB- all groaned  james still held his crotch in pain  0o0o0o0o0 three years later   lily had a boy   james cried  rushing out of the delivery room at st mungo s   congratulations  prongs   remus said  thumping his friend on the back   that s great  mate   sirius hugged his best friend   would you like to see him   james asked them  they both nodded  in the delivery room   lily  can they see him   james asked  walking over to his wife  who was holding a baby wrapped in a blue blanket   yeah  sure   lily said  remus and sirius walked over  grinning from ear to ear as they looked down at the baby boy   you have a name for him  right  james   remus asked   we re calling him harry  lily would nt let me name him james  his middle name is james  though   james grinned   james  wow  i ca nt see how you made such a cute kid  remember the day i kicked you in the --   sirius started  but james cut across   shut up  sirius  you saying it will only make it hurt again   james said warningly  back in the hallway   remmy --  sirius started to say  but remus smacked him upside the head  hard   if you say you re bored  i m never talking to you again   remus warned  sirius shut his mouth  but pulled a wireless radio out of nowhere  but before he could even turn the thing on  remus pulled out his wand  pointed it at the radio  and said  avada_kedavra   when he did  the radio started to smoke  then broke into a thousand tiny pieces   you clean that mess up   remus said  striding away  sirius sighed  he was bored  again  well   wait   he had a godson now  he smirked evilly  he could offer to baby-sit for lily and james  he decided that he would never be bored again  review  -LRB- ',\n        'chapter 1  next-door neighbours he s in the hallway  looking like he s from another star  with the hallway being what it is  worn linoleum  stained walls  cold lighting  the epitome of ugly  and him being him  the contrary of everything unsightly  even if he did nt yet get around to comb his hair  or change out of his night blue brocade dressing gown  it s the early afternoon  and i ve just come back from campus   harry  can i come over and borrow your notes tonight  did nt make it to class today  slept in again   i know he did  i ve been scanning the auditorium for his bright head the whole morning  all through curse tort and magical property law  always expecting that weird jolt it gives me to see him  but he never showed up  same as most days  actually  i really need to quit the compulsive checking   that okay  einstein    sure   i say  aiming at cool  it s still a struggle  after all these months  our first year at college will be over in two months  time  we ve been next-door neighbours in lcwl hall for over half a year  and for just as long  he s been living off my notes  he comes to my room every single night to borrow them  and to lounge on my bed and tell me about the cool folks you meet at the crystal balls where he works as a bartender four nights a week  or the clubs he plans to hit that night  and generally the pleasures of going out  teasing me in every other sentence about my hermit ways  if it was nt kind of absurd  considering  i d say he s my best friend  and yet i ca nt shake this tension  a tension that s got nothing to do with animosity or competition these days   great  see you then  einstein   he says  but he does nt turn away  he flashes me his smirk   einstein was nt a lawyer   i say  momentarily dazed   i know  man  i know he s famous for his poems   he replies  grey eyes twinkling down at me  making me feel super dumb for lecturing him on muggle facts when he knows everything  he s like constantly partying  but somehow he still manages to know everything  he s smart  and sparkling  and a hundred kinds of beautiful  merlin  this thing i have about him ca nt go on  i ca nt be infatuated with a guy  and i m not  i m with ginny weasley  and he is draco malfoy  i ve got to focus on his faults  he used to have a ton of those  why the heck is it that i ca nt think of a single one right now  his smirk  that smirk he s putting on to raise my hackles  i hate that smirk  it does nt make me wonder what his mouth would feel like on mine   hey  everything okay  darling   that s another one of his nicknames for me  darling  it s what gay people do  call people darling  i hate it when he does that   all good   i say  then cough to cover up the tremble in my voice  for a moment he looks at me  concern creasing his perfect features  i used to think of them as pointy  when he looks concerned for me  it s worse than his smirk  my knees go so weak i need to put a hand to the wall  his scrutinizing gaze intensifies  the problem is  he knows about the series of operations i underwent after the battle  everybody knows about it  i got out of it okay  i could nt be a bikini model  with that tube map of scars on my chest  but else i m all good  i just ca nt face syringe wands or surgical lights or people talking about st mungo s  i guess you could say i m a little bit damaged that way  he ca nt know that  but hell  it feels like he does  and like he cares  and he s just so damn darn handsome   harry    all good  man   i repeat  looking at his chest so i do nt have to look at his face  only his chest is perfect  too  wide  and bulging in all the right places  i m not checking out his muscle definition  i m not  there s his necklace disappearing in his shirt  i do nt know what kind of pendant he s wearing on that necklace  but i imagine it resting against his skin  warmed up by his body heat  i shift my gaze yet again  to his arm  he s got nice arms  too  for fuck s sake  there s a single golden hair on his sleeve  shining against the gown s dark blue  i focus on that hair and say   i m just really tired  dray  pulled an all-nighter for magical creature rights class  you know   he nods   always ready to travel the hard road to bring justice to earth   he says   that s my saviour    shut up  malfoy  or i might decide to duel you   i retort  my voice a little firmer   you do nt want that    but i totally do    you sure  you realize it d ruin that lovely undone look you ve probably spent hours working on   i gesture at his unkempt hair  he cards his fingers through the gleaming  golden strands  grinning down at me   you know what potter  you got a point there   i do nt know how it happened that our endless fighting morphed into this friendly banter  the summer after eighth year  he came back from france  and we met in this dorm  in this very hallway  and he said   hey  every day in the saviour s presence again  what a treat   but there was no edge to it  that old animosity was just gone  yes  i would never have thought it possible  but he s kind of my best friend these days  he himself has dozens of friends  friends who are very different from his old set  after his acquittal  he did nt rejoin the ranks of the old wizard nobility  those who had supported the dark lord but were able to evade prosecution  his father among them  were quietly readjusting in the sanctuaries of their country homes  licking their wounds  focussing their energies on protecting the assets that had nt been taken from them as bail or compensation  draco never went back to malfoy manor  instead  he came to the capital  enrolled at london college of wizarding law  and plunged into the party life of the young and the hip  quickly becoming one of its primary players  i am back to being the loner i was before hogwarts  minus the dursleys  ginny  hermione and ron have all moved to devon to study auroring in plymouth  plymouth magical university is just fifty miles from the burrow  and offers the most renowned auroring course in england  i did nt come along  everyone thought i d become an auror  i used to think it myself  but if i know one thing  it s that i wo nt fight anymore  not using a wand  anyway  wizarding law has always appealed to me  granted  it comes with a lot of tiresome reading  but it does have to do with justice  and i enjoy the way conflict is being dealt with in law  words  arguments  no wands  no curses  instead  an established  orderly routine of civilised dispute  yeah  some might call my subject stuffy  but i like it  draco and i are the only hogwarts students from our year who enrolled at lcwl  dean and seamus and neville are in london  too  but they re over at mag med campus  studying to become healers  somehow it s like you live in different cities if you live in different dorms  i guess i could have formed some new friendships  but college is different from school  you can spend whole days on your own without anybody noticing  you go to classes  have your meals at the canteen  but you can still be alone if you want to  or if you ca nt face the strain of being chatted up by people who just want to talk to you because you re supposedly a celebrity  who do nt understand you are nt up for talking about the battle of hogwarts like about a movie or one of your rougher quidditch games  i hate being made to talk about the war  it s just no topic for small talk  there s nothing entertaining about it  and certainly nothing glamorous  all that a war does is leave people with loved ones lost  and in my case with a fear of operation lamps and with fat ugly scars that are never going to fade  scars that ll probably always hurt to the touch  just like those memories do nt bear being touched on  -- draco stands with his head tilted  observing me  his smirk has softened into a smile  his smile is something very peculiar  it s just this gentle twist to his lips  the gentleness paradoxically enhancing the subtly mean aspect of the set of his mouth  it effectively conceals his kindness of soul  not from me though  not anymore  when he smiles at me  it s like he really does know everything  all these things i never talk about  like he understands  yeah  his smile is really the worst   i need to lie down   i say  and it s like the first thing i ve said that is nt a lie  and then  because i have this urge to touch him and no reason nor right to do it  i lift my hand and pick that hair from his sleeve  he gives a low chuckle and a shake of his head   you go do that  darling  bye   and then he s off  making the world go dim  taking all the reasons to keep going and stay alive with him  or so it feels for an absurd second or two  i need to call ginny  when i m back in my room  i sit down at my desk with my wand in hand  but i do nt call ginny  instead  i open my palm where i hid his hair  levitating it with wingardium_leviosa  i sit back and meditate it like it was a rare piece of magical gold  shoot  i need to clear my head  i get up and pluck a bottle of pumpkin juice from the old cardboard box i m using as a magical fridge  i got that box second hand  and it does nt retain the frost spell like it s supposed to  i ve been meaning to get a new fridge box for a while now  but i never seem to be getting around to it  it seems i just do nt care enough  i gulp down the lukewarm juice until the bottle is empty  i m about to throw it in the bin  then i do nt  instead  i use cleansio on it  then carefully catch hold of the hair still floating above my desk  i let the hair slip into the bottle  screw the lid back on and put the bottle on the shelf above my bed  pathetic is not a strong enough word for this  for me  i m not gay  i do nt watch gay porn  i do nt fancy guys  or him  i do nt want him to kiss me  if he ever kissed me  i d implode  chapter 2  a proposal when he comes getting the notes that night  he s ready for a tour of the bars  he s wearing his purple shirt with the glimmer hex that creates the impression of a flame permanently slithering round his body  and black  very tight jeans  jeans that say pinch my ass if you dare do it  sicko  or perhaps they only say that to me  he s beautiful and hot and radiating energy and purple light and  oh merlin  i wish i was him  i d like to know what it feels like  just once  to be wanted by everyone  and for the right reasons  for being sexy and gorgeous  not because a guy needed killing and destiny showed its twisted sense of humour by picking you for the job  perhaps i should have changed out of my tracksuit  put on something a little more stylish  i did contemplate it  but it felt such a pitiful thing to do that i decided against it  besides  he knows my tracksuit  we are so beyond the stage of first impressions  it s absurd that i m even having these thoughts  he has brought sweets from his mother  i do nt really like it when he does that  because it feels like he s paying me  like i m the nerd who fools himself into believing that chocolates mean love  narcissa malfoy s sweets are top-notch though  nothing like the dry  saccharine chocolates of aunt petunia s  there was a time when i would have killed for those  but in my aunt s case  chocolates actually did mean love  and she kept them all for dudley   best regards from my mom   draco says as he watches me pick a croacoa bonbon and stuff it in my mouth  i do nt know if she actually said that  if she knows her son dumps her gifts on his next-door neighbour in exchange for lecture notes  but she does smile at me and calls me harry dear whenever we bump into each other in the hallway  her smile is attractive these days  crinkling up her face like it should  maybe it s got to do with the fact she and lucius malfoy got separated  she s still a stunner and likes her stylish outfits  she looks just as out of place at the hall as her son  i like to think she s smiling at me and calling me dear because draco is telling her nice things about me  i put the parchments i prepared for him next to the chocolate box on my desk  then sit down and open a random book so he ll know i do nt expect him to stay and pretend this is a social visit   pick another one   he says  pushing the box of chocolates closer to me  i obey  because those croacoa bonbons are just too good for modesty  he observes me  his gaze on me strangely intent  like i was his guinea pig that s been under the weather for a while  and like he just managed to trick me into accepting a food treat  this is nuts  i m nuts  nuts  and nerdy  i m probably really going to pull that all-nighter on magical creature rights tonight  and he s going to have fun  i m not mingling much  but i do nt live under a rock  i know as well as the next hall resident who s doing what in their private lives  and draco is doing guys  like all the fucking time  he does nt do dates  he has never gone out with anybody  he goes out  full stop  it seems that he s following a personal etiquette forbidding him to fuck anyone he has nt randomly met at a bar  for him  freedom it is  or so i ve heard him say  with freedom apparently translating as fucking strangers  all the fucking time  i guess i should be disgusted by it  by him  but disgusted does nt exactly nail what i m feeling when he s with me in my room  like now  perhaps it s his scent  the strange  alien truth is  i want to climb him and sniff him all over  like i really was a guinea pig and he my stuffed animal friend that i got for enriched environment purposes  and it does nt make any sense  oh heck  i wish he d just take those parchments and leave  but he does nt  he never does  what he does is linger  pick up things and inspect them like he was assessing stuff at a sale  mess with the quidditch posters on the walls  steering the players into near collisions with his wand and chuckling to himself with childish schadenfreude when they fall off their brooms  check the fridge box and tell me i need to get a new one  have one of his mom s chocolates and slump down on my bed  kick off his pointy snakeskin shoes and stretch his luxury body  claiming he pinched a nerve in his back  leaving it to my imagination in what particular circumstances  when he pulls out my pyjamas from under the duvet and smirks because they re plaid  i start to feel irritated  and kind of fed up with the mess of emotions he elicits in me  but then he gets up from the bed and reaches for the empty bottle on the shelf above  the bottle with his hair in it  and i tense up like mad  he amuses himself for a while with letting the bottle do somersaults above his head  then gracefully snatches it from the air  to my utter relief  he just carelessly throws it in the bin  calling me a slob  then moves on to check out my collection of school quidditch cups on the window sill  he leans across my desk  or rather  across me  to get a better look  it s funny to think how it used to be my ultimate goal in life to catch the golden snitch on the hogwarts quidditch pitch before he did  and how i used to hate him   merlin  was i mad every time you beat me  darling   he says softly  picking up the cup from fifth year  and for a moment it feels like our minds were magically linked  without any need for legilimency   i guess i just could nt deal with being a failure and you witnessing it first-hand   he laughs  shaking his head  still contemplating the cup in his hand  something is pulsating under his shirt  in the area of his pectorals  he s got those  the shirt he s wearing leaves no doubt about that  the purple fabric is the super elastic kind  and it s softly vibrating  it must be the pendant on his necklace underneath that does this  it almost looks like he was hiding something there that was alive and had a heartbeat of its own  or maybe this is just my vision giving out under the impact of the fancy fibre s magical glow  and of his physical proximity  i edge out of his way as best i can without letting the ridiculous rise in my blood pressure become too obvious  and surreptitiously stare at him from the side  he s close enough for me to see the stubble on his jaw  he should shave before going out  he really should  god  he looks so  yeah  i guess dishy is the word  with that shirt on and that golden shadow accentuating his jawline  he s so going to get laid tonight  it s none of my concern  he can shave or not  he can have sex or not  he s going to though  because it s who he is  a gay man who is one-hundred percent sure of himself and his sexuality and who calls people darling and who gets laid  on a daily basis  all of london s wizard twinks spread their legs for him  and the muggles probably  too  well  i do nt care  i m not gay  i m in a relationship with a lovely girl that i love  why should i care  i know he s a top  not that i d care  but it s not like i live under a rock   listen  darling  why do nt you come join me tonight   he has turned around to me  i push back my chair in a reflex to put some distance between us and stare up at him  not comprehending   come on  harry  let s paint the town   let s  what   no   god  no  the mere idea  being in a gay club  being a shaggy mongrel among a hundred birds of paradise  and him seeing it  the contrast  my ordinariness suddenly all standing out  he knows i m the plainest guy who ever made the headlines of the daily prophet  but there s no need to rub it in his face  and also  i d have to watch him do his thing  he has leant back against my desk  his stance wide  his long legs framing me as i sit on my chair before him  i feel trapped and so too hot   i ve been thinking about you  darling  you need to live a little  you used to be up for all kinds of shit in the old days  with granger and weasley  where s that gryffindor adventure spirit   my chair topples over as i get up  blindly retreating  my spirit  it blew up in a green blaze that killed a part of my soul  a foreign  evil part  but it had been there for seventeen years  growing as i was growing  getting ingrained in my being  and when voldemort s curse extracted it from me in that moment of indescribable agony  i got ripped up  and my soul bled out inside my body  and i only realized it was happening when two days later i started vomiting green blood and collapsed in it  next thing i knew i was looking into surgery lamps like into the eyes of a nine-headed monster that was tearing me to shreds  and maybe the doctors saved my life  but they could nt save me  i m this shell  he s been thinking about me  he has pushed himself off my desk  but he has nt stepped up to me  he s keeping his distance  thank merlin he s keeping his distance  but he does nt let up   come on  we ve been out for a drink before   we have nt  we ve met up at costa s for a latte and a muffin  that s all   harry  i m talking the bong  hippest club in town   he has no idea how scary that sounds  or perhaps he does  he s reaching for my hand  he has grabbed hold of my hand   you re going to have fun  i promise  i ll show you how  okay    no  dray   i extract my hand from his  i just ca nt be in my room with draco malfoy  holding hands with him  even if it s just him trying to make me go out and find myself a fuck  it must be a sort of social experiment thing  yeah  i guess he really does see me as his guinea pig   i ll buy you a drink    no    a pumpkin juice    take theo   theodore nott is studying in london  too  he lives at mag med hall  and from what i ve heard  draco and his former fellow slytherin enjoy a notorious strike partnership in the city s gay clubs  they are nt an item though  i might have asked a couple of clever questions to make sure   theo wo nt join me  he twisted his neck apparating the other night  and the bong is nt on the floo network  it s very backyard  so if you do nt come along  i got no one   it almost has me scoff  no one  alright   that s too bad for you then  dray  but i m not coming along    why not    no reason   i say  feeling panic at his insistence creep up on me  his smirk ghosts across his features   how s ginny   shoot  ginny  of course  that s what i should have said  i m not coming because i m with ginny  because i m not interested in hooking up at a club  i already got someone  totally forgot ginny  and i do nt know how she is  i have nt called her in a week   ginny weasley   he says  pointing at her photo on my nightstand as if he needed to clarify which ginny  the photo is lying on its back under another empty bottle of pumpkin juice and a pair of socks and a pile of old quidditch magazines  this is sending the wrong message  ginny is important to me  merlin  she s so much more than that  i would nt have made it through the months after the battle of hogwarts  the repeated operations  the torture of rehabilitation  without her and her family  and eighth year in those makeshift containers south of london that served as a substitute for hogwarts  those days when i was toiling on like a zombie and people stared at me for being weird  the nights when my chest hurt so much it was like that green curse was ripping me up inside all over again  it would have been intolerable without ginny by my side  or the visits to the burrow  with hogwarts gone  the burrow was all i had left by way of home  it is to this day  i could never break up with ginny  breaking up with her would mean losing everything that s the old times  it would mean losing the connection to the days before the battle  when i still felt i had a life  he has picked up the photo  long fingers dexterously peeling it out from under the rubbish  and contemplates it  ginny s waving from her broom  grinning broadly  until the dust on the photo makes her sneeze   she s great  we re great   i say  voice trembling  shit  my hands are trembling  too  he puts the photo back and steps up to me  i do nt meet his gaze  his mouth is at eye-level with me  i bite my lips  like something horrid might happen just from me looking at his  something horrible is going to happen  even if i do nt know what s it going to be   it s all good   he says in a low voice  like i was an especially nervous foal and he a cowboy intent on calming his charge before getting started with breaking him in  and that s so the wrong mental picture  is it possible to get a heart attack at age nineteen  if i had one  he d have to perform first aid on me  i d be lying on the floor  and he d have to touch me  he d check my pulse  and open my jacket  and put his ear on my bare chest to catch the feel of my breathing  and here s another picture that s wrong on any and all levels  god help me  i need to get out of this  i do nt really care anymore if it s dead or alive  only it seems i ca nt move my darned feet  or my brain   harry  do nt space out on me  man  i did nt mean to freak you out    you do nt  you did nt  i d love to join you  obviously i would  but i m tired  plus  i m not into clubbing    plus  you are nt gay   he prompts  yeah  i should have said that first   that too  yes   he takes another step towards me  shit  stay back  you mind-shredding sorcerer   you do nt look that great  harry   i scoff   i do nt mean it as an insult  you know i do nt  here  have another chocolate   i take it  just to make him back off  he watches me munch and swallow  and i just wish he would nt  it s still good to have the chocolate   you sure you are nt sick    maybe i am  maybe a coming cold   i say  it s the simple excuse i somehow did nt think of  if you do nt want to go places  you say you got a cold  easy as pie   i already told you  darling  lie down    i did  i will    come on  do it now    i will when you re gone   i say  feeling like a stubborn two-year-old  no way am i going to lie down on my bed with him still in my room  looking down on me with that face  so terrifyingly beautiful  and his eyes on me like he  like   do it now  else i ll be worrying about you  and it will spoil my night out  and you would nt want that  would you   he s teasing me  but there s this something in his eyes  god  i must nt start hallucinating  the quicker he goes the better  i quickly drop down on my bed and slip under the sheets   you always go to sleep fully clothed  what do you keep those plaid pyjamas for   i ca nt decide what s worse  him thinking i m a freak who d go to sleep fully clothed  or changing into my pyjamas with him watching  in the end i wriggle out of my tracksuit trousers under the sheets  hoping to somehow save a rest of my dignity  i kick the trousers out from under the sheets  merlin  i really wish he would nt stare like he does  like his mom never taught him the first thing about manners  i wish he would nt stay when he s clearly not wanted  but most of all i wish he was nt so frigging gorgeous in his going out gear  and with his hair framing his head like a heiligenschein  i rip off my glasses  better  now he s just a shadow of light   good night  dray   i say as firmly as i can   good night  darling   he says  quietly  like i was really sick and needed delicate treatment  then he s gone  good  it s good  it is  chapter 3  bernie s i ve slept for two hours this afternoon  i did lie down  because he told me to  i did nt need the extra sleep  i did nt pull that all-nighter  my room might be a bit of a mess  i might have motivational issues with managing stuff like getting myself a new fridge  but i ve got a routine of sleeping six hours straight every night  with my complete lack of a social life  it s kind of hard to build up a lack of sleep  so now  at half past ten in the evening  i m wide awake  thinking about him touring the clubs in pursuit of pleasure  i ve heard about his exploits  his escapades  they re legend  i did nt have to do any snooping to learn about stuff like how he won this year s costume contest at the egypt dressed up as a pharaoh with a hex that transformed his head and shoulders into that famous mask with the blue and golden stripes  then managed to have the prize changed from a voucher for a dinner for two to free booze for a private pharaoh-themed party at the club s main backroom  people say he recruited a dozen slaves from a hundred volunteers for that party  i can perfectly imagine how he sorted through the applicants to select the ones to his taste  then changed their clothes to just sandals and grass skirts with no more than a bored flip of his wand  he so could have been an ancient decadent emperor  i see him in my mind s eye  smirking   darling  you need to live a little   i guess he s right  if i do nt live  at least a little  then there was nt much point in not getting myself killed by voldemort  i ve long since stopped to subscribe to the wisdom that life s pleasures are worth its pains  because its pains just really suck  but maybe i m wrong  and maybe the fliers littering the hall s lobby do nt lie when they say you re in for the most epic fun of your life if you come attend the all-you-can-drink rave at the so-and-so club next friday  and then  he ca nt respect me if i m this weirdo  i do nt need him to respect me  obviously  or maybe i do  suddenly i ca nt bear to be who i am  the boring  damaged saviour  who could never be with draco malfoy  not even as his thirteenth slave  my gaze strays to the bottle in the bin  like i had nt just caught his hair in it but a genie  to be summoned in case of need  in a way  i did  i ca nt be with him  but i can be the next best thing  i can be him  - i ve got a polyjuice base in my medicine kit  all i need to do is put that base in my folding cauldron and heat it  then add draco s hair  preparing potions is strictly forbidden in lcwl hall for fire safety reasons  but i would nt have cared about stuff like that in the old days  back when i still had my gryffindor adventure spirit  i lock my door with securio  then get the cauldron out from under the bed  - i m draco  there s my new reflection in the mirror on my door  it s blurry  until i realize i need to lose my glasses  my tracksuit looks so absurd on draco it makes me grin  and that s his smirk on my face  his face  i watch it  for the first time at leisure  god  that smirk  it s so sexy it makes my toes curl  and my groin twitch  it s crazy and a little bit creepy to pop wood from watching yourself in the mirror  i turn away  i ve got a plan  i need to focus  i m going to go out as draco malfoy  which means i ve got to lose this tracksuit and change into my coolest clothes  as i dig through my cupboard  i realize that all my stuff is really ancient and plain-jane  or plain-joe  whatever  in the end i decide on a pair of combat trousers and a plaid shirt  the trousers need a bit of lengthening  needlecraft magic is nt my strong suit  but the result of my tailor hex is passable  the shirt is okay  i bought it in double xl because i like my clothes baggy  so it fits draco s built  and it has got long sleeves  that s good  because the polyjuice did nt replicate the dark mark  he s still got that  most of the times he keeps it covered up  he has developed a kind of tick actually  a continuous tugging on his left sleeve  he is nt aware he s doing it  but i know he s trying to make sure the sleeve is covering the mark  there are those times when he forgets about it though  sometimes his sleeve rides up his arm when he pushes his hair back  smiling down at me  it s remarkable how i ve stopped to really see the skull and snakes  that image used to be so powerful  the icon of ultimate evil  these days  to me at least  it s just a friend s old  tasteless tattoo that he got in his troubled teens  i button the cuffs  then check my outfit in the mirror  i look good  hell  of course i do  i d look good in anything that is nt harry potters old tracksuit  i m draco gorgeous malfoy  and i m going to paint the town  - bernie s  i picked it because it s the club that sounds the least gay  the least scary  but the moment i m past the bouncer  who waved me through after he had just told everyone in the queue that the club was full  it becomes clear that i ve done this thing they call step outside your comfort zone  in an instant  i find myself in the centre of a group of boys who seem to have been lingering in the hallway with the sole purpose of meeting up with me   hey  d  good to see you  what s with the shirt    draco  sweetie  gim me a kiss  what s with the shirt    d  come here  you know you want to  gorgeous  love your plaids   they touch me  too  one of them  a scrawny boy with a face like a girl and a number of vicious-looking nipple piercings under this torn dragon hide shirt  is hanging off my arm  i was never good with receiving attention  and then this kind of attention  i plain do nt know what to do with my face  with draco s face  or what to say  i ve got to say something though  or my cover will blow  it would be so totally embarrassing if he ever found out  nobody must find out  i ve got to pull through with what i started  i ve got to play draco and be convincing   hey   i say  because inspiration is a bitch  then upgrade to   hey guys   trying to sound like him  self-assured  a little aloof  it s bad i do nt know any names  else i could say something like  timothy  please let go of my arm  you are ruining my shirt  but then draco would probably call nipple piercing darling  anyway  so i try it out  and it works  the guy lets go of me  looking at me with renewed adoration  absurdly   how about we go outside for a bit and share a ziggy  my treat   he chimes  turning towards the entrance to the club s main hall down the corridor  i tell nipple piercing i ll get back to him later  apparently it was the wrong thing to say  he wiggles his metal-studded tongue at me  clearly labouring under the delusion he just received an indecent proposal  obviously  draco would nt bother with making up excuses if he was nt interested  i hasten towards the blare of music coming from the main hall  hoping to disappear in the noise and bluish darkness  -- the club mostly consists of a vast dance floor with a bar in the centre  the walls are lined with red leather booths  much like in a muggle steak house  it s quite nice  really  or it could be  if there were nt so many people staring at me  like i was the minister of magic  or his model lover  or like they expected me to perform some kick ass magic on the spot  maybe not the world-saving kind but rather some fantastic dance stunt or something  but it s not that different really  yeah  maybe being draco malfoy is nt that different from being harry potter after all   draco  d  hey  it s steve  over here  come dancing   the dance floor is packed with people  i ve got no idea which one of the dancers is steve  but dancing sounds like a good idea  dancing is better than talking  safer  i wedge myself onto the dance floor  answering nudges and smiles with draco s smirk  and start moving to the beats  i have ever only danced at the hogwarts christmas ball  and i did nt do much dancing then  either  from the corner of my eye  i observe the other dancers  trying to copy their moves  it s not that hard  left foot  right foot  knees flexing  hands swaying  this is going alright  it s even kind of fun  i can do this  people still stare  even more so than they did before it seems  i try to ignore it  two guys come dancing up to me  one with a black ponytail  the other with shiny red bangs  both of them in very skinny jeans  i guess one of them is steve  they are pretty guys  about my height  about harry s height that is  as draco  i m a head taller then they are  i m a tall blond  drawing pretty boys  yeah  i really do nt enjoy this as much as i expected  the crazy truth is  i m jealous  jealous of these hot guys that are coming on to me  because it s really draco they are coming on to  and if he was me at this moment  or rather  himself  he d take them up on their offer  and i hate that  hell  i d really appreciate it if these two exercised just a little more restraint  their hands are all over me  and now they have started taking turns grinding their trim backsides against my front  i m a rookie  but even i can read that dance style  it means that i m expected to make out with them  it freaks me out beyond anything  i m straight  that s why   i need to go to the bathroom   the one with the ponytail screams over the music   you coming  d   hell  this is  out of my comfort zone does nt even begin to cover it  hell  i guess i had to expect something like this to happen  this is a club  people come here to get action  and these two obviously expect me to give them said action  because i m draco malfoy  super stud  i have to act my part  act draco  but i ca nt do it  clumsily  i extricate myself from between the two boys and flee  only where to turn to for refuge  the bathroom  the classical choice in cases of social stress  obviously is nt safe  for want of a better alternative  i head for a booth in the club s darkest corner and dive right under the table  pretending i need to fix a problem with my sneakers  they do nt come after me  it seems i have escaped  but the respite does nt last   taking your tragic romance to the next level tonight  not even getting your rocks off anymore   when i emerge from under the table  i see it s theodore nott  with a mug of butterbeer in hand  at least i know his name   that why you chose to wear sneakers   he asks  pointing his mug at my feet   and that shirt  and those trousers  you trying to scare people off  i can see your socks  man    shut up  theo   i say  prodding him in the ribs like i ve seen draco do it  but playing my part is nt what s foremost on my mind  tragic romance  he just said something about draco and a tragic romance   what tragic romance is that supposed to be   i ask  trying to sound bored   yours  your excuse for fucking every hole that s moving    do nt know what you re talking about  darling   at least that s one honest sentence   come on  are you trying to get back into the closet here  not gon na work with me  mate  i know your dirty little secret  it s your own fault  talking my ear off every time you get drunk  whining about all the sex  and how it simply never makes you forget your mystery man like it s supposed to  and how you ll be in love with the guy forever   his brow creases  he seems to be inspecting my shirt  or its plaid pattern  then  without any warning  he reaches out his hand and slips it inside my shirt  down my chest  i jump backwards  but apparently it s not a move  dealing me a hearty whack in the shoulder  he cries   you re not wearing your amulet  man  so you really got over him  good for you  draco  all he ever did was make you miserable   he takes a swig of his beer and repeats   good for you  i think i know who the fucker is  anyway  i always wanted to tell you  he s not worth it  forget him  stop the sick pining   theodore is so right  that guy sure is nt worth a forged knut  mystery man  i wish i  too  knew who the fucker is  i need to cast a real nasty  disfiguring hex at him  heck  it s probably a long-legged  sleek-haired twink with no glasses  and no brains  right then  another one of those comes sashaying up to me  seriously  they re like flies on shit as the poet would have it  this one s got pink and platinum hair and swimming trunks that must be the result of a paint spell  he s batting charmed lashes at me   hey  gorgeous   i do nt react   i m sasha  in case you forgot  you up for it    just leave me be for a sec  sasha  okay   i say   you sure  gorgeous  i remember your impressive equipment   i blush so hard my face feels like coming off   i could nt walk for a week   he purrs  leaning in to me  the guy is talking about getting fucked by draco  i hate him so much i forget being embarrassed to have my equipment addressed   well  i do nt remember yours  darling  but i m sorry to inform you you are nt up to my standards   i say  aiming a pointed glance at his mid section  he looks mortified   that was short for buzz off   i clarify  he walks off  looking utterly deflated  i guess i should enjoy it  being able to be nasty without any personal consequences  getting to brush off people who think i m hot  even if it s just guys  that s it  that s the problem  i do nt enjoy this because there s just guys here  no girls  because ginny is nt here  ginny is my girlfriend  i would want her to come on to me  no one else  i do nt care if draco fucked this sasha guy so hard he could nt walk for a week  in fact  i would nt care if he had fucked him so hard he d dropped dead   darling   theo says by my side  mimicking my acerbic tone   what s your problem   i snap  i turn on him  and he shrinks back a bit  i m draco  i m all kinds of toned  i could crush him without using my wand  i love polyjuice   you do nt call people darling  at least i ve never heard you do it before   theodore says   you re weird tonight  d  and shrugging at me  he saunters off  i take a deep breath  relieved at seeing him leave  when he turns around one more time   did nt you say you d check out the bong tonight  the place not up to your standards  either   shit  oh man  i did nt think of that  shit  he s going to see draco at some point  and they are going to talk  draco is going to find out about this  i tell myself to calm down  he ll know somebody polyjuiced into him  he wo nt know its me  he wo nt know its me  i need a drink  that s one good thing about being in this club  there s a bar here  and they are bound to have cold drinks on offer that deserve to be called that  i walk up to the counter  automatically bracing myself for the task of getting the barkeeper to acknowledge me  there s a problem with my body language or something  i m the kind of guy who gets ignored by bar personnel  at least when i m wearing lenses and when my scar is nt visible  the barkeeper waves at me when i m still yards away from the counter  of course  i do nt have my glasses  or my scar  but i look like draco malfoy  king of gay england   the usual  d   the usual  it s probably some kind of hard liquor  like firewhiskey mixed with something even worse  i ca nt afford to get wasted  and i will if i drink alcohol  after my operations  the healers told me to avoid it  and now i m not used to it anymore   i ll have a pumpkin juice   i say  guillaume s eyebrows shoot up so they vanish under his bright blue fringes  i know his name is guillaume because it says so on his name tag   what got into you  cheri   he says  the shock bringing out a strong french accent   you got the stomach flu  you like a snakeweed tea   i find that i d love that  in case he can make it an iced tea  and tell the guy that  he stares at me  then starts laughing   you re shitting me  man  you nearly got me there   he wags a heavily ringed finger at me  then goes on to smoothly prepare some toxic looking drink  he does a couple of barkeeper stunts  like letting the bottles do a break dance act on the counter  then directing two different liquids into the cocktail glass in intertwining spurts  like the dna double helix  in the end i get a green and silver striped drink with a little cloud of fog rising from it like liquid nitrogen  i m forced to take a sip under guillaume s expectant gaze  i try not to grimace  by gryffindor  that s worse than poppy pomfrey s coughing potion  my eyes water  he s still watching me  no  he s watching my shirt   where s your amulet   he asks   you over him   hell  so draco poured his heart out about mystery man to guillaume  too  well  i guess it s kind of a classic  with the guy being a bartender   that man is ancient history   i say forcefully  wishing he was  i hate mystery man  i ca nt very well ask guillaume if he knows who it is  and i ca nt ask how much my usual drink is  either  so i throw a gold galleon on the counter   what s that supposed to mean   guillaume says  i got no idea what that s supposed to mean   you do nt want that tip    i want our deal  you are buying my drinks at the crystal balls  i m buying yours here  remember    i just thought your management might not be okay with that   i say  floundering   sure they are  they know it s you   he says   they know it s me   he looks at me like he s fearing for my mental health   you make a place a place to be  mais cheri  you keep saying that yourself  do nt tell me you do nt remember that  either   i meet his gaze  i have to  else he s going to start suspecting i m a fraud   sure i remember   i say  and then  with as much arrogance as i can muster   sure i make a place a place to be  it s what i do    now that s my draco   he says  pointing at me with his wiping cloth  and before i can tell him draco is nobody s draco  he leans across the counter and continues talking to me in french  he s speaking fucking french   it was good talking to you  guillaume   i say resolutely  then turn to go   guillaume   he echoes behind me  as if he had never heard his own name  i wave and start walking away   hey  what s the matter  what about your drink   i ca nt drink that shitty stuff  i ca nt do this going out thing  catching one last glimpse of guillaume s cobalt fringes and bewildered expression  i turn on my heels and apparate back to my dorm  -- okay  going out as draco malfoy was a flop  but there s something else i can do before the effect of the potion wears off  i realize that in the hall s squalid bathroom when i m pulling my dick out to pee  - at first i ca nt even look at my cock in my hand  his cock in his hand  i m back in my room  i ve locked my door with a double securio hex  and soundproofed the walls  too  but this is going to be anything but a relaxed wank  it s a mindfuck  it feels like i m jerking him off  and sasha got it right  impressive is the word  ten inches  a girth to match  and uncircumcised  i fight down the weirdness and the feeling that somehow  he must know what i m doing  heck  i want to beat off  and i m going to  i can do it too  it s not exactly rocket science  i grab my unfamiliar  extra large erection with both hands and concentrate on getting into a rhythm  pump up and down  brush my thumb across the glistening crown every couple of seconds  yeah  it s not that hard  it s pretty damn nice  actually  oh yeah  it is  yeah  i m starting to enjoy myself here  i tackle the fat shaft more aggressively  and as pleasure and heat are swiftly building in my groin  the soundproofing spell starts to make sense  god  merlin  this is good  groaning and thrusting  i rub myself towards completion  spurred by the sense of doing the wrong thing  now i m relishing the fact that it s his cock i m working  relishing its sheer size and the supple feel of the mobile sheath  there s a tiny brown birthmark on it  god  i m trespassing  oh god  i m coming  when i spurt the first shot  it hits me straight in the face  the semen slides down my cheek into my open mouth and it tastes like his scent  that s dray s come on my lips and tongue  i hear myself whimper  i ca nt think about why i m making that sound  there i am in the mirror on the door  there s draco sitting on my swivel chair  trousers and shirt undone  sculpted chest heaving  king-size cock shooting come across my desk  it goes on and on  because the sight is just too hot for me to stop  eventually i look away from the mirror and lift my butt  twisting my body so i can push my middle finger into myself  i ve done this before  if not using my own come but the stuff from the muggle drugstore to smooth things along  i ve read about it  twenty percent of the straight male population use anal stimulation when they masturbate  it does nt make me gay  but i m imagining it s his cock that s pushing into me  putting its sperm into me  and that sure makes me less than a hundred percent straight  and a hundred-and-ten percent a pathetic loser  - thanks for reading  next update due in a couple of days  if you d like to share your thoughts  please do  any and all feedback appreciated  -RRB- chapter 4  a doctor s appointment three days later  i fall sick  i feel nauseous like never before in my life  after two days of vomiting every half hour  it gets worse  i ca nt even hold my pumpkin juice anymore  that night  i go see the college healer  i ve never done that before  the college healer has the power to have people sent to st mungo s  the place where they got those torture theatres with the monster lamps under the ceiling  but then this ca nt be anything worse than an especially vicious gastritis  probably triggered by guillaume s disgusting striped drink  people do nt get surgery for having gastritis  the healer lady will give me a stomach potion and send me home  she s double the size i expected  got freakishly bushy grey eyebrows  and she has seen a tad too many sick students in her time  judging from the way she does nt even look up from her parchments when i walk in  she just gives me a random wave with her wand  apparently it is a standard request to lose whatever garment is in the way of an examination of the area in question  i lift my shirt and point at my belly   i think i upset my stomach  i had a drink the other night that tasted really weird  and   she gets up with quite a bit of puffing  i m still talking about that drink when she puts her wand to my stomach  she bends to peer through the wand like through a telescope for two seconds  then stands and says   congratulations  dear  you are expecting   okay  what  what was that  expecting  like in  i m pregnant   men do nt get pregnant   i say  because they do nt  only it seems that they do  the healer lady gets all worked up at my ignorance  at least to the extent of her capacities  she has laboriously sat down again and scribbles away on a parchment  grumbling to herself   those professors at hogwarts   she says  making the word professor sound like the worst of expletives   they teach all kinds of crap  divination  astronomy and what not  and what s the result  kids getting themselves into trouble because they do nt know the basic facts of life   she shakes her head  working her eyebrows   stuffy hypocrites  stuffy professors   then she seems to be getting aware that i m about to fall apart like a third hand tournament broom  she gets up from her chair again  this time surprisingly swiftly  stuffs a petri dish in my hand and pushes me down on the cot by the wall  and then she starts talking  really slowly  and pausing after every other word  like she thinks i was mentally challenged and needed the extra time to follow  i do  actually   right  dear  now listen  men do get pregnant  at least wizards do  a wizard can get pregnant by another wizard  all it needs is semen being deposited in the anal canal  in the butt  okay  male pregnancy is rather rare though  because it only happens when the birth father has chosen the sperm father as his ultimate mate   his ultimate   but he is nt   i stutter   i have nt  he s no such thing  we are nt anything like  ultimate mates    oh   she mouths  her thick brows wrinkling up  it makes her look like a character from the magical muppet show   the sperm father is nt committed to you  i m sorry   she s kind of nice really  but i m not in a place where i could appreciate it  i m kind of preoccupied with words like sperm father  and my life coming crashing down on me   but how can i be pregnant from  from    it s reproductive wizard biomagic  dear  complicated field  the fact is  a pregnancy can occur in a wizard if  and only if  he feels bonded to his sex partner    bonded   i parrot   bonded  like in marriage  wedlock  lifelong monogamy  simply put  the emotion activates hormones in the wizard s body that make it receptive to the partner s sperm  it s not required that the other wizard is on the same page  so to speak  for his sperm to take root in the birth father s body  your body  i m really sorry  dear   my head is spinning  and i ca nt talk to this lady about what really happened  i ca nt talk about polyjuicing into draco and using his body to jerk off  and putting a finger in my butt  a finger covered in draco s sperm  she rummages in her healer s kit that seems to be as spacious inside as hermione s beaded handbag  and digs up a pile of leaflets  fast facts for single parent wizards  male pregnancy  your baby s magical first year  ministry support and everything you need to know  oh my god  i m going to be a single parent wizard  i must have turned even greener than i was when i first came in here  the healer lady looks at me  brows twitching  then does some more rummaging in her kit  handing me a vial with a clear liquid  she tells me to down it   i m afraid you ll suffer from nausea for the whole course of the pregnancy  that would be for another ten to twelve weeks   what  ten to twelve weeks  she ca nt be serious  nobody can be expected to deal with regular vomiting for that amount of time  she does nt seem to realize that though  she s all breezy now  all positive   see  it s not that bad  you ll be done in less than three months  time  that s a third of what women go through  it s going to put a strain on your body  i wo nt lie about that  but you ll deal   she grins serenely  then says   the kid will be delivered with a small operation  nothing worse than an appendix operation  it has proven to do much less damage than natural childbirth with males  just make sure you come to the hospital as soon as you experience the first contractions  that ll leave the healers a couple of hours to prepare you for the operation  do nt worry  dear  you ll be fine   i ll be fine  i almost scoff  now i m going to have an operation  too  like having the world as i know it go to shit and holding a leaflet about single parenthood in my hand was nt enough  i m expected to walk into st mungo s and let them cut me up all over again   do nt forget to enrol him at hogwarts  you can do it before the birth  you ll want to secure him a place   him  it s a son   it s a popular school   i nod  at least that  i know  i walked in here expecting to leave with a prescription for a stomach potion  now i m going to enrol a kid at hogwarts  my son  draco malfoy s son  draco  merlin  he can never know  author s note  this chapter is a little bit on the short side  but i ll post the next one in two or three days  thanks for reading  as always  feedback is appreciated  chapter 5  a visitor i ve moved to a studio in a tower block outside london  i could nt stay in my room at lcwl hall with draco checking in on me every five minutes  telling me this was nt normal  and threatening to take me to st mungo s  and researching my symptoms on the wiznet  in the end i sent him away  claiming i needed to sleep  then contacted a housing agency that offered fast track relocation services  those guys could do magic worthy of the name  within five minutes  i got my new address  along with a collapsible self-transporting trunk that easily fit my modest belongings  all i had to do was apparate over  the rent is cheap  for the time being  i can make ends meet  but since my operations have eaten up nearly all of my savings  things are going to get difficult once they take away my grant  and they are going to  because i m not going to college anymore  i ca nt go to lectures with this vomiting thing going on  and even less so with my waistline corrupted like it is  not when draco might decide to start attending lectures and see me  not with people at lcwl hall talking like they do  i have to drop out eventually  anyway  i ca nt go to lectures with a baby  can i i m going to have a baby  in two months  time  already  my stomach looks like i swallowed a bludger  the one good thing being  i never really made any friends in college  so no one is going to come look for me and see it  i told ron and hermione that i ca nt meet up at the moment because i took on two more elective courses on evidence in wizarding law and am buried in work  and i broke up with ginny  over the wand  because how could i face her  looking all pregnant  she does nt know about the baby  and she never will  i will figure out a way to keep it a secret  because how could i ever face her  yeah  maybe i did nt technically cheat on her  but having a baby sure makes it look like i did  talk about prima facie evidence  and what s worse  to anyone who has read the fast facts on wizard pregnancy  the baby is proof of guilt that i m in love for life with someone else  with a guy  what s worse is  if i do nt keep the baby a secret forever  there s the risk that he ll learn what happened  i ca nt face ginny  but i sure as hell can never ever face him  no  i ve got to do this in secret  on my own  to be on the safe side  i put a concealment charm on my flat so it ca nt be tracked  it s a bit like back in the old days when i needed to hide from the dark lord  only now i m all on my own  and i ca nt hide from what s going to happen to me  all i can do is wait  and watch my belly expand like the frigging universe  and imagine going to st mungo s to have a fucking operation  oh merlin  i m scared shitless  - ten weeks down  two more to go  i m looking like i m hiding a keg of butterbeer under my shirt  and i m thinking of st mungo s all the fucking time  i ca nt go there  i ca nt  there s just one solution  i m going to do that other thing  natural childbirth  spontaneous delivery  apparently people bleed to death when they try that  at least wizards do  forty-two point eight percent of them  at least that s what they say in my leaflet  but i just ca nt go to st mungo s  there s fifty-seven point two percent who do nt bleed to death  and i might very well be one of them  i ca nt have that operation  a fifty-seven point two percent chance of survival is nt zero  - i m scared  scared  scared  - draco is at my door  there was a knock  and i threw my bathrobe on  holding it together above my belly and slipping sweatpants  and opened the door  expecting to see the owl from the wizard welfare office  i applied for housing benefit  and there have been a lot of letters going back and forth with requests for bank certificates and supplementary information and stuff like that  i got used to having that owl rap on my door  i expected that owl  and instead it s him  in black slacks and a fitted white shirt and his shiny hair grown so it falls into his eyes  eyes all stormy  like he hexed them black  he s looking like a movie star  like hollywood s ultimate ladykiller  and completely  utterly mad  how did he find me  how  he s pushing past me  looking around   what are you doing in this dump   he demands  voice sharp   why did you leave  why would you sneak away like that  and  hell  why  harry  why   when i do nt answer  because i ca nt line up any words  he marches over to the window like he meant to do something about it  then stops like he forgot what it was  when he turns around to me  his face is all flushed  it s blotchy  really  i ve never seen him with a blotchy face   you quit your course  you re the best law student at lcwl  you re the fucking einstein of wizarding law  damnit  you care for that stuff  you ca nt drop out   he runs a hand up his brow and through his hair  it stands on end  i ve never seen him with his hair standing on end  i stare at him  he gives a forced laugh   i ca nt be expected to find someone else to lend me their notes   he says   can i    dray   his hand flutters in a gesture encompassing my unappealing bedsitter   and seriously  concealment charms  you thought i would nt find you like that   this is nt about him  at least he ca nt know it is   you should go  dray   he turns on me as if i had cast a slapping curse at him  eyes ablaze   you look like shit  man  something happened to you  and you are going to tell me what it is  now   since the moment he entered my flat  i have felt the rigid stupor that has kept me upright for the last twelve weeks dissolve  and this is the moment i break  i pull the bath robe away from my stomach  his jaw drops  his eyes nearly pop out as he just stands and stares  i do nt care  i m beyond caring  i might die of spontaneous delivery  or worse  have surgery  and i tell him  i tell him that i m pregnant  safe for how it happened  safe for the part with the polyjuice and my finger and his sperm  i tell him everything  when i get to the part with the surgery  i start crying   i ca nt have an operation   i choke   i ca nt do it  i wo nt  i m not going to st mungo s   maybe a part of me hoped he d sweep me into his arms and tell me that there wo nt be any operation  because he knows a charm that ll get the kid out of me just like that  maybe that part of me imagined he d then proceed to tell me he loves me  but he has kept to his place by the window  still as a statue  all through my outburst  when i m done  his eyes on me are like sharpened stones   you are nt serious   he says in a clipped tone  as if he thought i was winding him up  it helps me pull myself together   i am  i m pregnant  draco  i know it s weird  but it can happen to wizard males    i know  i m not judging you for being pregnant  harry  for merlin s sake  i m telling you you need to have the kid at st mungo s  harry  you ca nt do this on your own  here   he seems to really dislike my flat   i can  too   i say  intending to sound mutinous  i do nt  my voice is like a frightened kitten s   you ca nt give birth like a woman  harry  you re going to get ripped up if you try   he steps up to me  holding my gaze   darling  i do nt mean to scare you  but you need to understand  you need to let me take you to st mungo s when you have that kid  else you might die  i wo nt have you die  you understand   i nod  he nods  too   right  when is your due date   that moment  something rips through me  something so vicious my heart seems to stop  when i can see again  i m in his arms   okay  darling  it s starting  do nt panic  just hold on  i m apparating you to st mungo s   author s note  next chapter coming up on sunday  love your reviews  -RRB- chapter 6  daylight a hospital is a place where you stop being a person  you stop being someone who acts  who s in charge of themselves  the moment you apparate beyond those gates  you have delivered yourself up to the system and its supernatural powers  outside that place  you might have been the saviour  or at least some one  but once you re inside you become that thing called a patient  a unit to be worked on  with vital functions  but no life of its own  all that s expected of you is to suffer  and comply  and it s what you do  because you ve got no fucking choice  and i ve been sent through hell over and over at this place  and i could nt even take the smell of it if it was nt for draco by my side  i let him do the talking at the reception desk  holding on to his arm like to a lifeline  waiting in terror for what s going to happen to me  the receptionist looks like she s bored out of her mind by her job  obviously considering her option to order us to go to the waiting area and just stay there for the foreseeable future  but then another one of those contractions starts rolling  and i go to my knees even as i m trying to cover it up  and i know i ve set the wheels of the place in motion  -- when i resurface from that wave of pain  i m lying on a gurney  someone has hexed my clothes off of me and replaced them with a hospital gown  and a plastic bracelet with my name on it is attaching itself to my wrist like a handcuff  i try to sit up and instantly find myself being pushed back down  a freakishly fit-looking  shaven-headed nurse who never brooked any opposition in his life i m sure asks me to please stay put  then whisks me off to an examination room  draco edges himself through the door behind the nurse  i strain my neck to keep him in my line of sight   you the sperm father   the nurse asks draco  o hell  o god  o merlin  draco shakes his head   i m a friend of mr potter s    in that case i ll have to ask you to leave  mister   the nurse says   but i want him to stay   i croak from where i ve been parked in a corner   please    sorry   the nurse barks  not sounding anything remotely like it   family only permitted on the labour ward   he motions to draco to leave  i close my eyes so i do nt have to watch him go   i m staying with him   draco says   family only  mister   the nurse repeats   this is the rules    and what about people who got no fucking family   draco cries  the blotches on his face reappearing   you fucking know he s got none  fuck  you fucking know he s the fucking saviour  for fuck s sake   i ve never heard him use the f-word before  or refer to me as the saviour without a trace of irony for that matter  so i m pretty stunned by that outburst  the nurse needs a second to recover  too  then says  all professional coolness   you do nt get it  mister  there s no point in staying  he s going to have his operation really soon    that s okay  i m going to stay for the operation  too   that moment  another contraction hits  i ca nt stop myself from uttering a whimper  because it really hurts  and because i m going to have an operation  draco is by my side  his hand digging into my shoulder  it feels like he s trembling  or maybe it s me   it s going to be okay  darling   he says  and then  with his voice all different again  all imperious   do something  for merlin s sake  ca nt you see he needs a painkiller charm  do your fucking job  man   i want to tell him to stop  because you ca nt say fuck to hospital staff like that  i need him by my side for as long as possible  i ca nt have him be removed by some security wizard with a baton for a wand  and he so will be if he goes on shouting at the nurse  but the next thing that happens is the nurse murmuring a spell  and the pain in my stomach receding  i m being helped climb off the gurney and onto a bed  and then i receive a briefing on what s going to happen  i ll have another couple of hours until the operation  because we need to wait until there wo nt be any more intermissions in between contractions  or so the nurse tells me  apparently the baby needs to be exposed to those for as long as possible so there wo nt be any trouble with his breathing later  the nurse announces he ll be back in half an hour to shave me and put magical electrodes on me so they can monitor the kid s heartbeat  and then he leaves  looking past draco as if he was nt there  he did it  he stood up to a fucking nurse  he changed the rules  i d be at his feet with how much i worship him if i were nt already lying flat on my back  there s still that operation waiting down the road  but it makes just a world of a difference to not be alone  draco is going to stay  he s going to keep me company  for the next couple of hours  which means that sooner or later he ll ask me the question  whose is it  - he does nt do it  there s only this short moment when he busies himself with conjuring a spouted cup and says  his back towards me  his voice all light   and here i was thinking you were this old-fashioned guy who waits for the right man to come along  then marries and lives happily ever after  but it seems you simply got your fun discreetly    you knew  you know that i m  i m    gay  of course i knew  tried to coax you out of the closet  but that did nt work out  did it  well  i know why now  you ve been in a secret relationship all this time  with someone you felt was your mate   of course  he knows how pregnancy in wizards works  he knows everything  he does nt need a silly leaflet with the fast facts  he s gay and open about it and informed  not a clueless idiot like me  he has handed me the cup  sitting down on a stool next to my bed  when i ve obediently sipped some water  he takes the cup from my hand and puts it on the window sill  then leans forward   harry  where s the bastard  why did he leave you   i want to say something  feed him that story i have nt really made up yet  but instead i am swallowed by another contraction  it goes on for almost half a minute this time  leaving me sweaty and disoriented   sorry   he says when it s over   o merlin  sorry  darling  i did nt mean to upset you  here  have some more water   he lets go of my hand and gets me the cup again  he s been holding my hand  the door swings open and the nurse comes in with a razor wand and a handful of electrodes  he asks  may i   the way they do it at hospitals  not really asking at all  then vanishes my gown  it was nt much of a gown  but it did its job and covered up my body  i ca nt look at draco  my belly is enormous  and it does nt help that the nurse is putting foam on it to shave off my pleasure trail now  hell  i look like a giant plum pudding with a topping of whipped cream  at least i m wearing one of those funny hospital panties that look like a saucy mini skirt  but draco is nt looking at my belly  or my groin  he s looking at my chest  yeah  he has never seen my scars before  he has never seen the ugliness that is my mauled chest  i think of his  its immaculate  classical perfection  and for a moment i could cry for being so damaged  then the nurse moves the razor wand up my chest and i cry for real  because it makes my scars hurt like hell   stop this  you moron   draco cries   you ca nt do that    i need to remove his chest hair so i can hex on the electrodes   the nurse replies  but he has stopped moving the razor wand  with a swift motion  draco reaches out and takes the razor from his hand  turning his back on the nurse  he bends over me  hair curtaining his face  and lowers the wand onto my chest  and then he starts moving the wand tip across the skin in between my scars  slowly  inch by inch   yeah  i do nt have that kind of time   the nurse says sourly   then you should thank merlin i m here to help you out   draco says  his eyes intent on what he s doing   you are nt even authorized to be here  mister   the nurse grumbles  but it s clearly a rearguard action  and on leaving  he tells draco to send him a wand message when he s done  - the healer who s going to do the surgery has come check on me and says we ll operate before nightfall  it s obviously not going to be me who s going to do any operating  however the guy chooses to phrase things  i m going to be the one who ll get cut up  before nightfall  i m so scared  and so exhausted  the constantly renewed assaults of the contractions have started to wear me out  when i ask for another painkiller charm  the healer says i must nt have any more of those  because they might affect the kid  draco shoots the guy a murderous glance that s not quite warranted  and the nurse  too  then tells me he knows i can do it  when we are alone again  he calls his mother  and a few minutes later her owl is at the window  with a box of chocolates attached to his leg  the window is a hospital window that does nt open to alohomora so people wo nt try and jump out  but draco is a slytherin who knows his shit  he vanishes the glass  then quickly unties the box and sends the owl on his way with a short tickle under the wing  it s the smallest of things  that tickling  giving the family owl a routine caress  but it s what suddenly makes me see  yes  at that moment it strikes me full force how i never got what he is  not even during the last year when he became my friend  and i developed that monster crush  how i was so preoccupied with his crazy good looks and the effect he had on me that i never really saw the wonderful  loving  caring person he is  i take a piece of chocolate from his hands  returning his smile  hoping he ll miss the wave of wild  desperate affection that s pulsing through me  i ve just put the chocolate in my mouth when the nurse is back  probably drawn by a sixth sense for funny business  he checks the window  which looks exactly like before  he prods against the glass  then peeks through  then looks at me and sees i ve got something in my mouth   what is that  what you eating    it s just a piece of chocolate   draco says  stepping between me and the nurse  the nurse says draco ca nt give me chocolates  dray says it s hardly making sense to make me watch my waistline at the moment  then adds that the chocolates are completely absorbable so there is no danger of asphyxia under anaesthesia  i love his smoothness and how he knows these medical terms and the way he s shielding me  merlin  i love everything about him  but the nurse clearly does nt  he says that draco being allowed to be here is a gesture of pure goodwill on the part of st mungo s  and that he better behave accordingly   sorry  sir  will keep it in mind   draco says  because i told him he must nt call the nurse a moron  but when the guy has left  draco makes a face at the door that nearly has me cough up the chocolate it s so hilariously disrespectful  he has this knack for lightening the mood  in his very own dray way  i never really thought about that  either  but ever since we met up again as fellow students  he has made me forget what s burdensome time and again with his cocky ways and unfaltering snarcasm  and he s doing it even now  i laugh up at him  and before i can start thinking about things again  he asks me if i already have a name  i have  and i realize i should discuss it with draco  he s the other father after all  i ca nt tell him that  but he still is   i want to call him day  short for daylight   i say  observing him   daylight   he says slowly   yeah  i like that  day  huh  sounds a bit like dray   i know it does   and light  that s like my second name  lucius   he says  his brow furrowing  the nurse comes back into the room  and for the first time i m happy to see him  but only for ten seconds or so  he checks my belly with his wand again  then says   fine  the slime plug is going to get discharged any moment now   oh man  it s just great  i m at st mungo s  waiting to have an operation  and with my stomach giving me hell every couple of minutes  and now draco heard that nurse talking about slime plugs coming out of my ass  i m spared nothing here  when the nurse is gone  i tell draco he can go now   you mad  i m not going anywhere  you hear me  i m staying   and actually witness that plug thing coming out  i do nt think so   you got to go  you are missing all your classes   i groan   i quit    what  you quit  you ca nt do that  you told me i ca nt quit    you ca nt quit  you re going to be a kick-ass lawyer  i m going to switch to business and finance  london school of wizarding economics   business and finance  huh  makes much more sense somehow  i can totally see him as a banker  wearing thousand-galleon suits  making millions with shrewd schemes on the edge of shady  and not giving a shit if people call him a shrake   why did nt you enrol there in the first place  dray    what do you think why  einstein  did nt get in   he says smoothly  too smoothly  suddenly i feel that him deciding to study law might have been part of a slytherin-style master scheme  it ca nt have been  but what if it was  what if he only did it to be with me  is this my hormones  and my crazy hopes  playing a trick on me  i need to know   listen   i start  then the next contraction chokes me off  bringing tears to my eyes  and this time  it does nt stop  wave after wave comes crashing over me  drowning in the pain  i hear draco run to the door and scream for help  - there s a lull  my body is weirdly numb  and my mind is  too  but i register my surroundings again  people all about  the room filled with hustling activity  my belly going cold with disinfectant potion  the stench of it  draco being ordered to stay back  and refusing  draco holding my hand  wearing a green mask and cloak  the surgeon stretching out his hands for the nurse to hex on the gloves  the anaesthetist healer with a syringe wand  he tells me it s a local anaesthesia  and how all their male patients have their caesarean with a local anaesthesia  and how it s so great that birthing fathers are able to stay conscious during the operation these days so they can welcome their baby  with the last bit of breath i got left in my body i tell the guy to knock me out  it s my only chance to get through this i know  a general anaesthetic  the kind that never worked on me when they tried to get voldemort s venom out of my system  the healer asks me if i m sure  then directs the syringe wand at my temple  starting to recite the spell for the general anaesthetic  i brace myself for the final prick into my arm   wait  harry   draco says  the healer lowers his wand  the surgeon takes a step back  in the middle of all the anguish  i still marvel at how draco does it  make these hospital guys give him space to talk to me  he is nt even authorized to be here  yet they treat him like he was a windsor or something  yeah  it s like he was prince william and i the duchess of cambridge about to be delivered of their firstborn   harry   he says  and his face before mine eclipses everyone else  everything else   do nt let them put you under  you ll regret that later  this is going to be all different from your other operations  this is about your kid  daylight  that s about as far from dark magic as you can get  right    but i m scared   i hate how small my voice sounds   you wo nt look into the lamps  you ll look at me   the next contraction hits  when i emerge from it  i m secured to the bed with magical straps  and the mattress is soaked in sweat  there s blood trickling from the corner of my mouth  i bit down on my tongue  and i can already feel the next pain rolling   we have to do it now   the healer says to draco   local or general    darling   dray says  his voice giving out   local   i groan around my swollen tongue   local  for fuck s sake   - they perform the anaesthesia spells  and draco is by my side  talking to me the whole time   you ll be fine  darling  this is simple surgery spells  it s all routine  and you ll heal in no time  and you ll see daylight  just a couple more minutes now  darling  and you ll see him   i can feel them do the surgery  i feel the magic of the scalpel wand slice through me  but it does nt hurt  the lamps are there  above me  but i do nt see their glaring monster s eyes  i only see draco s face  draco s beloved face and his hands holding mine are all that s real  and then i feel the healers touch the kid  they unearth him from where he started his life in obscurity  inside me  and my body tries to hold on to him  and ca nt  they put the kid in my arms  and i m clinging to draco s gaze  needing him to lead me over this abyss   you did it   he says from behind his mask  the grey of his irises dissolving to glistening silver   you ve done it  darling   i ve done it  it s over  they still need to patch me up  but i m holding the little creature that is my son cradled against my chest and draco is laughing and crying with me  and all is well  suddenly i m flooded with such joy my soul is nt big enough to contain it  my hands are moving over the kid  taking in the perfect little form  just feeling  it s what i got hands for i realize  for getting to know my son  for cupping his silky head and supporting his frail weight that s the weight of the world  and finally i look at him  really look at him  daylight  my baby boy  he is nt covered in blood or anything  he s like freshly bathed  rosy and glowing  his wispy black hair is standing in all directions  he s got my hair  only on him  it s perfect  and his eyes  they are so  so clear  like they are still reflecting the shine of the beyond  and they are the most beautiful of greys  they are just like the eyes of his other father  he s got the same face  too  baby cheeks  but the rest is all clean-cut triangles  apart from his potter hair and those funny hamster cheeks  he s every bit like draco  he s his spitting image   congratulations   the nurse says somewhere in the back  his voice gone all soft   to you  too  mister  why did nt you tell us you re the sperm father   and now draco looks at day  too  and i can hear him stop breathing  thanks for reading  thanks for reviewing  chapter 7  a promise draco looks at day  too  and i can feel him stop breathing  i can feel him turn to ice  suddenly his hands on mine are cold  like ice  the surgeon tells me i m fine and the baby is fine and that we ll have some time to ourselves now  then everybody leaves  it s just draco  me  and daylight  but draco is gone from my side  from our side  he s by the window  his back turned to the room  he looks out the window  completely still  like someone cast a frost spell over him  after what feels like half an eternity  he moves again  putting his arms around himself like for warmth  he croaks   he s my son  harry  he s my son  too  merlin  i   his voice sounds so agonized and helpless i hardly recognize it  and it seems i ve lost mine  what on earth could i say now  how could i even begin to explain  but he does nt ask me how day can be his son  or what i did  or why i lied to him  instead  he turns to me and says   i ca nt leave   i ca nt leave  what  he shakes his head   i ca nt just walk out of here and get on with my life now  i ca nt do that   he crosses his arms in front of his chest in a strangely defensive gesture  a twisted shadow of his smirk tugging at his mouth   your mate left  so maybe there s a father s slot free for me  maybe you got some use for me   i m adrift in surprise and complete confusion  why is nt he mad at me for lying to him  why is nt he pressing me for an explanation  why is he acting like he does  all weird  he gives a hoarse laugh  shaking his head again   you do nt want me in your life  do you  or in his  i get it  harry  you d rather raise him alone than have me around  i m just this kid you know who s trying to make everyone forget he s a death eater   something like a dry cough chokes him off  fuck  he is nt allowed to do this  he s a self-centred pleasure-seeker who s living the high life of the socially blessed and never loses his cool  and i just ca nt bear to see him break like this  and because of me  too  because he thinks i m looking down on him and blaming him for old choices that never even were his own  it seems i was too busy with my own traumas to realize about his  and how deep they run  he s still suffering from the past  and he s obviously suffering much more than i ever realized because of his mystery man  the asshole rejected him and made him feel he was unworthy  and now he s assuming that i m rejecting him  too  he thinks i never told him about day because i do nt want anything to do with him  that s why he s saying these horrible things  why he s still making this horrible  coughing sound  i need to touch him  do just something  stroke his hair  or feed him a chocolate so he ll stop  but he s too far away  and i ca nt walk  there s just one thing i can do now   dray  do you know how it happened  how our kid happened    sure i do  you polyjuiced into me  then had sex with your friend   he says thickly  he thinks day is his son because i love someone else  who fucked me while i was polyjuice draco  he knows about the polyjuice  for a moment  this throws me off   you know about the polyjuice    come on   he says with a faint scoff  sounding a bit more like his old self   people have asked me about my plaid shirt and combat trousers  and insulted me for dancing like a moron at bernie s the other night  apparently i ordered a pumpkin juice  too  i am no einstein  but i can put two and two together  you decided you wanted to try out night life after all  but did nt want anyone to know you re gay  so you took the first available gay guy s hair   this is so far from the truth  and he needs to know the truth  because our son has just been born and there ca nt be any lies  not at this moment   i did nt polyjuice into you then had sex with a friend   i say  then close my eyes and take the plunge   i polyjuiced into you then had sex with myself   - i ve never seen a person change like he does in the fifteen second it takes him to process this admission  it s like he polyjuiced into someone else  into his old  fifth-year self  he s all self-satisfied  insufferable malfoy  he has figured it out  of course he has  he knows what i did  and he knows that it could lead to day for one reason only  he knows that he  draco malfoy  is officially  certifiably  magically approved  the love of my life  it s cringeworthy  but i wanted to make him stop crying  and i did  he s wearing his worst ever smirk now  and he keeps paraphrasing what i told him   you wanked off being me  and got my spunk in your butt  and got pregnant  you made yourself come while you were me  and got pregnant from that  from my jizz   yeah  it s nice that he s better  but i really wish he would stop talking  and looking so awfully  horribly smug  he has pulled his amulet from his shirt  it is a tiny  beating silver heart  he contemplates it for a few seconds  then shoves it down his pocket like it was an old sweet wrapper to be discarded later  he s laughing  looking at me  shaking his head and laughing again  i was so curious about the secret of that amulet  but right now there s no room in my brain for anything but misery and humiliation  i basically told him that i love him  and he s laughing  yes  now it s me who s feeling wretched and inferior  i guess i should be used to the feeling by now  it s been my main emotion for the last academic year  only somehow i ca nt deal anymore  i guess you ca nt give birth to a baby holding hands with the other father  who s also the man you ve tried not to be in love with for almost a year  without having your mind kind of reorganized  for a couple of hours  my life was worth the pain  and it was pain of the serious kind  i was hurting and freaking out because of the healers and the lamps  but i was with him  and he stood by me  and it was all i d have ever dreamt of  if i had ever dared to  and then that perfect moment when his arm was around me and day  like we were family  like this was our future that was starting  it s not required that the sperm father is on the same page  so to speak  i bury my face in day s hair   hey  hey what is it  harry   he s gone down on one knee by my bedside  looking up at me  and his hand goes to my face  his thumb strokes up my cheeks  catching the tears   what s wrong  are you in pain  shall i call the nurse    no  it s okay   there s the sound of something like a tiny toy power saw  it s day  crying  i m making my baby cry   here  let me take him  darling  you need rest  you ve been through a lot   draco strokes my hair back from my brow  then gently picks up day  the way he cares makes it so much worse  and the way he s holding day  cradling him  rocking him against his chest and kissing his head  it did nt take him even a moment to start loving his son  god  i know why i fell in love with this man  even if i did nt have the brains to realize it when it happened  he loves our son  at least he loves our son  fuck those tears  what s left of my dignity is dissolving in a puddle of salt water and snot  he does nt seem to notice  he gets day to sleep with a funny little song about flying on a broom on a fine day  it s a traditional tune from the malfoy nursery or so he s telling me  and now he s bending over the baby cot by the window to carefully lower day into it   you know  harry  i feel cheated   he says  standing  okay  i guess we have to have this talk  so better get it over with   i know   i say  wiping my nose with the back of my hand   i m sorry  draco  i know it s not okay to polyjuice into someone without asking their permission  and then  i know i messed up  i made you a father and you never got to make that decision    you did nt get that one right  einstein  i feel cheated that you made me a father and i never got to sleep with you   i open my mouth  then shut it  blushing like never before  he s still standing by the cot  arms crossed now  all casually  and smiling sardonically   are you going to blush every time i talk about sex    i  what  no  i   i splutter    because if you do  i m going to talk about it a lot more in the future  you look totally kissable when you blush   in the future  kissable  he s walking up to my bed  i stare up at him  like a rabbit in the headlights  tilting his head  he gives me a wink   fuckable   i feel myself blushing harder   merlin  harry   he says   you need to say something at some point  you ca nt have a guy come on to you and never ever say anything in return  the minimum would be  sod off  jackass   he s coming on to me  when he knows i love him   do nt sod off  jackass   i murmur  his face lights up   now you ve said it  you want me    you know i do   i whisper   it s still nice to be told to not sod off   he digs up the silver heart from his pocket and looks down at it  it s intricately patterned and vibrating in his palm with its strange  magical pulse   i ve been wearing this for ages  ever since seventh year  remember the night in malfoy manor when you wrestled my wand from my hand   he laughs  shaking his head   that was a moment in the middle of hell  but you touched me  and all i wanted was make it last  and the last thing i did with my wand before i let it go was cut a curl from your hair  you never noticed  did you  that s the beauty of messy hair   i do nt understand what he s telling me  he s talking about a night two years ago  the night in malfoy manor when i was held captive there with my friends  and the dark lord had been summoned to come and finish me  draco let me take his wand that night  is that why it gave me its allegiance  is that why i could beat the dark lord in the end  he took hair from me  too   i used it for a hex  locked it into this heart and charmed it  wearing it made me feel like you were mine   he smirks  looking like a total crook  and beyond vulnerable  my mind reels  he s been wearing that heart for mystery man  he s in love with mystery man  he s telling me the guy is me  that s what he just said  i m mystery man  he puts the amulet on the nightstand  dismissing it  turning to me   see  darling  i want you  too   he does nt call people darling  only me  because i m mystery man  i ca nt process this  i ve just had an operation  and a baby  and now the man i had resigned myself to pine for in vain for the rest of my life is telling me he wants me   why would you want me   i search for his smirk  because that kind of line surely deserves it  but it is nt there  there s no smirk  no wink  no laughter in his eyes  their cool grey suddenly looks like molten  strangely sizzling  it scares me and makes my heart flutter with something very different from fear at the same time  but i really do nt get it   you ca nt even be respecting me   i whisper  his brows come up   why would nt i respect you  harry    i drink pumpkin juice and i m this terrible dresser   i blurt  now he scoffs  and smirks   oh yes  you do  and you are  but you re also a hero  no  let me say it  just this once  i do nt mean the hero from the headlines  i mean the true one  who had the courage to take on an evil others did nt even dare name  and who defeated that evil because he was the only one who had the strength  and who was ready to pay the price  harry   his voice is catching in his throat  but he goes on   you could have hardened with what happened to you  to make it hurt less  or just give up  you could have sought refuge in vanity  or party potions  but you did nt  you re too noble and too strong for any that  there s not a soul on earth i respect more than you  harry   i look at him  silent  because i know he ll never spell this out again  then i ask   but why would you want me   yeah  it s a real bad line  and now i ve said it twice  but still  why would he  he shakes his head at me   okay  so you really want me to spell it all out  perhaps i was wrong about that vanity and nobility of character thing  right  okay then   he sits down by my bed like for a bedtime story   i want you because you are the cutest guy i ever met  you could wear a pillow case and still look delicious  shut up  i know you do  i used transmuros on the dorm showers once  yeah  sue me  you got to see me naked  too  did nt you  so i d say we re even    but    quiet  plaintiff  you asked for an answer  now you ll listen  - okay  i want you because you got the perfect snow white colouring all over  and the most wonderful hip bones  and just enough muscle to not be meagre  and i really love how you re more hung than you ve got a right to with your modest size  quiet  i m not done  i love the gawky way you move  and the way you kind of transform when you do magic  or fly your broom  how from one moment to the next you like change into this epitome of elegance and control  it s just so crazy hot   he looks at me  eyes shiny  and i m flooded with a warmth that s equal parts embarrassment and euphoria  i want to say something  make light of this  but he holds up his hand like a policeman  stopping me  and then he lowers his hand onto my hair and starts carding the strands through his fingers   your hair makes me want to run my hands through it for the rest of my life  your eyes give me wet dreams  and your lips  the way they stretch when you smile  the way they fill out when you listen   his eyes have zoned in on my mouth  and then he bends forward and kisses me  i ve always imagined i d implode when he d do that  i do nt  i faint from it  when i ve fought my way back to consciousness  he has pulled back  looking shell-shocked  it s too humiliating for words  but then i guess you could say i have been through a lot   you okay  darling  merlin  i m sorry  i was nt thinking  you need to rest   he steps back from the bed as if he did nt trust himself to keep his hands and mouth off of me  o hell  i love that  hell  draco malfoy is in love with me  he has been in love with me all this time  for all kinds of absurd  wonderful reasons   you know  dray  i feel cheated  too   i say  gingerly sitting up   that i got pregnant by you when i never even went out with you that night    is that so   he says  his eyes are suddenly dancing  full of mischief   then that s what we re going to do  as soon as you re back on your feet  do things in the right order at last  get a babysitter  go to a club  dance for a bit  have some drinks  and then who knows what might happen   his smile hits me in the heart  then slithers down to my groin and all the way to the tips of my toes   you are asking me out  you want to go out with me    i do  darling   i know he s just answering my question  i know it s absurd to feel this hospital room has just turned into something like a temple of god  just because he told me he s going to take me to a gay club  but then he says it again  quietly  solemnly  the smirk gone   i do   and this time i know it s not just in my ears  this time i know it s a promise  sacred  and for life  do nt miss out on the next  and final  two chapters  -RRB- thanks for reading  chapter 8  going out he s at the door of our tiny student family housing flat to pick me up  he left for a walk twenty minutes earlier to be able to do that  his outfit is the same he wore that night at the dorm when he tried to talk me into hitting the clubs with him  and he s looking like he s from another star  i polyjuiced into him  but i never looked anything like him  i realize  because his beauty is nt just in his features and his physical perfection  it s in his way of moving  in his grace and his easy  natural superiority  he steps up to me and his hand is on my shoulder  lightly  as he brushes a kiss on my brow  i strongly feel the intimacy of it  the monopolizing  as if we did nt yet know each other and he meant to stake his claims right at the beginning of our first night out  he asks me if there s someone dependable in my class who ll lend me their notes  because i have skipped the evening lecture on law of charmed negotiable instruments  then he compliments me on my outfit  it s black jeans and a plaid shirt  plaid has had a revival  people are wearing it all over the place these days  i suspect it s got to do with the fact that draco malfoy chose to wear a plaid shirt to bernie s the other night  that shirt is not what i m wearing tonight though  my shirt is new and fitted  because dray put in a veto against my old one  inspecting our reflection in the mirror by the front door  i tell him he had a point  day cries a bit when we kiss him goodbye  and narcissa tells us to make it quick  she forces a chocolate on both of us  because young parents are sleep-deprived and  need all the energy they can get   grandmothers are supposed to say things like that and hand out sweets i know  though i never had one  but narcissa malfoy is not your textbook granny with her supermodel mane and gowns and air of sexy sophistication  plus  she s a slytherin  i ve come to think there s more to those chocolates than meets the eye  but i trust her like a molly weasley these days  and i do need all the energy i can get tonight  so i take two pieces  both draco and i kiss day again  and he realizes something s amiss and starts crying  narcissa lifts him up into her arms and shows him his gryffindor lion  it s from ginny  and it s about double day s size  it can roar and swish its tail and caper about  and draco maintains it s too big and scary for a baby  but day loves it  and i do  too  because it s ginny s blessing  gently rocking back and forth on the balls of her feet  narcissa lets the lion dance in the air in front of day  he switches from crying to his hiccuping baby laugh in a blink  narcissa starts singing that song  out in the garden  on each fine day  with my snitch i like to play  i fly my broom  i fly my broom  i fly my broom on each fine day  never stopping the singing  she motions to us to use day s moment of distraction  we do it and disapparate  feeling like criminals  we apparate in the street before the house  giggling  our gazes meet  and we fall silent at the same second  and then dray puts his hands to both my shoulders and leans forward and kisses me  he does nt pull me in  and his deliberate restraint fills me with breathless anticipation  - he takes me to bernie s  when we walk from the apparition vip lounge into the club  i trail a couple of steps behind him  feeling dizzy  and it s not the aftershocks of apparition  i feel like in a dream  this is so surreal  i m back at bernie s  with draco as my date  he moves through the crowd with utter confidence  and o yeah  this could nt be any more different from the first time i came to this place  it s like a home match now  no fear  almost no nerves  even though people stare  and i mean stare  us moving in together  and having a baby together  has made us the talk of the town  i know that  even though i ve spent the last weeks confined to my bed in our flat  with draco keeping watch over my recovery with fierce determination  warding off each and every one who tried to visit  and making sure i did nt get to do just about anything  not even take my juice glass to the kitchen sink  he could nt stop me from reading the daily prophet though  and reading about how  the wizarding world ca nt wait for harry potter to make a public appearance with his live-in lover  playboy and former death eater draco malfoy  actually did activate every single one of my hermit reflexes  but it turns out that with draco by my side  i really can take on anything  not just having a caesarean  but also any amount of public attention  people do nt only stare  they step in our way and plant kisses on us and shout all kinds of jests and good wishes and lewd remarks  maybe it helps that i m unable to take in much of my surroundings tonight  because i have eyes only for draco  i ve known how beautiful he is for half my life  but seeing him here  in the club s bluish light  dressed up for our first official date  it s a bit like i m seeing him for the first time  and i just love how he s steering me through the club  all proprietary  with a swagger in his walk that advertises his totally insane pride at being with me  every couple of steps he turns to give me his smile  teeth flashing  and it sends a thrill down my spine that i feel like i ll drop to my knees  or else fly away  - when we say hello to guillaume  i realize i did everything wrong as polyjuice draco  i did nt ruffle guillaume s blue fringes  i did nt let him kiss me  i did nt call him joe  apparently nobody calls him guillaume  what does he wear the silly name tag for then  and he can call himself joe all he wants  he s still a french guy with hair that s way too blue  but of course draco would nt mind that  the obvious truth is  he likes it  shit  the obvious truth is  he likes joe-guillaume  i m positively grateful when a group of three sexy boys walk up to us with the unmasked intention of ganging up on draco to get into his pants  they wedge themselves between me and draco  interrupting joe-guillaume  who has just started to speak french  i step back to give them space to do their thing  anything so i do nt have to listen to any french  draco realizes something is nt right at that point  he shoves the three guys to the side  nods at joe and pulls me away   hey darling  what is it   i ca nt tell him that  it s not cool to be jealous  least of all of a frenchman  his gaze follows mine  and he laughs and pulls me backwards into his embrace so i feel every muscle in his body   joe s just a friend  you ll love him once you know him   i do nt think that s true  but i ca nt talk  not while i feel his body warm and strong against my back  his arms around me  his thighs pushing against my butt  his head is bowed down to me  his lips are in my hair and his breath tickles my ear   come on  darling  let s dance   - dancing with draco is magical  i still do nt know how to move my body on a dancefloor  i ca nt do this rotating of hips and twisting of shoulders that in the club s magical lighting turns him into an archaic deity of sex  i still try  and i guess i m making a fool of myself  again  but i do nt care  because draco is dancing with me  and he looks at me like i m the only man in the club  the only man in the world  - later  in a booth  we share a pumpkin juice and a glass of joe-guillaume s striped poison  draco claims it s the best drink in town  it does nt take more than that to rekindle my aversion to the guy  and i tell draco i m surprised he d say that  what with him being a london bartender himself  i know it sounds catty  and that i m so not being cool about this  but i ca nt stop myself  i m just about to ask him what happened to his slytherin competitive spirit  when he says   darling  i ve never slept with joe   instantly  i find my spirits rise again  but just for a short moment  because just then  someone comes walking up to us  and it s sasha  his hair is black tonight  and he s wearing a fishnet belly tee  and he s hotter than i can ever hope to be  he nods at me  acknowledging me with an odd mix of reverence and contempt  then turns to draco   seriously  pumpkin juice   he purrs   listen  i m considering letting you make it up to me   draco looks confused   make what up to you   he does nt remember sasha s name  ha   what you said about me  about my dick being too small   sasha specifies  surprising me with his candidness and lack of regard for his dignity  draco looks surprised  too  he shoots me a quick glance  then tells sasha his dick is fine and he did nt know what got into him when he said it was nt  and then he says he s with me   but you do nt do dates   sasha says   i do nt  harry is nt a date  we are going out  we are together   now sasha is really looking at me  but when he talks again  he s still addressing draco   so it s true  you turned into a vip babe  malfoy  too bad  let me know when you re back in the game    you know what  man  get lost   yeah  he forgot the guy s name  and he s told him to get lost  but he did sleep with him  just now  on the dance floor  i felt like i was the only man in draco s life  the only man in his future  present  and past  but i m not  i can never be  because maybe he did nt sleep with joe  but he did sleep with sasha  and with a hundred more  or rather  with a thousand  sasha stalks off  when draco talks again  i hear his voice like from far off   so you really did set out to ruin my social standing  and not just with your plaids  you stole my hair  then went and pissed off my conquests  very slytherin for a gryffindor  i must say   i know i should laugh along  and i want to  i really do  but i m unable to hide my feelings  i get up and walk away  not caring where i m going   harry   he cries  coming after me  all across the dance floor  out into the cool  dusty corridor  i do nt head for the apparition lounge  if i tried to disapparate now  i know i d disintegrate  and i ca nt do that  i ca nt dissolve into nothingness  however much i might want to at this moment  because there s still day  a few yards from the exit  in the empty  coldly lit entry area  draco catches up with me and grabs my arm  i turn around  shaking him off  sobbing   i m sorry   he cries   i m sorry    you got nothing to be sorry for   i croak   it s not like you cheated on me or something    harry  i m sorry  really i am  you know i only did what i did because i hoped it would help me get over you  you got to understand  my amulet did nt just help me cope  i could nt live without it  and i hated that  i wanted to make my feelings for you go away  that s why i hooked up with people like i did   i know it s the truth  i know that nothing about him is what it looks like at first glance  he s the centre of attention wherever he goes  yet he always needed to hide who he was  he has always been admired  and at the same time secretly struggling  suffering  feeling like a failure  first because of his father s expectations on him  and later because of those who ll always be judging him for his past  yeah  i understand what it means to be him  i have for a while now  not since when i became him using polyjuice  but from the moment he showed me that hidden silver heart  and perhaps i ve known since much earlier  since when i first learnt to love his crooked smile  i know he has never had it easy  and i know that he is mine  i do  it ll still take me a while to get over the fact that like fifty percent of the guys in this club  and in the scene  know him in a way i do nt  in a way they ve got no right to  and maybe it s just ten percent  or two  but it still hurts like hell   i m sorry   he repeats  reading my mind  his eyes on me  pleading   you ve always told me how much fun you were having going out   i blurt out  blindly looking at the waving djane on the bill on the black wall next to me  hating how whiny and accusatory i sound   it was nt fun   he says with such emotion  such rawness it makes me look back at his face   going out and hooking up is only fun when you re looking for something  hoping for something  when it s a treasure hunt  for me  it was a tranquilizer  a trick i used on myself  like the amulet with your curl    you know i d have given you my heart instead of that bloody curl any day  if you d ever asked   my eyes have started streaming with fresh tears   why could nt you do it  dray  why could you hook up with all these guys  but could nt ask me if i wanted to be yours   i know i m being unreasonable  i know i ve been acting like a fool for a really long time myself  taking emotionally incompetent to unknown levels  actually  i wait for him to point that out to me  but he does nt  he stands before me  his right hand tugging at his left sleeve  he has never performed this automatism with such tense insistence   i was scared you d turn me down   he says hoarsely  all the while pulling that sleeve down over his wrist  over his mark  his fingers are creating tiny tears in the shirt s delicate fabric   please  harry  tell me i did nt ruin things  please tell me you wo nt leave me   i do nt know what it is that makes me get a grip at last  having him reveal his feelings to me like that  like i never thought he ever would  all defences down  or seeing him ruin his magical designer shirt without him even noticing he s doing it  he loves that shirt  i must nt allow this to go on  he must nt look like that  my gorgeous  arrogant  snarky draco  like a kindergartener who s been told he has nt been a good boy and wants his teddy bear  i feel like i might break in half with how much i love him  i grab for his hand and tell him i want to go home  author s note  i ll post the next and last chapter later today  -LRB- please be warned  it will contain mature content  -RRB- chapter 9  coming home when we get back  day is asleep in his cot  draco takes his mother home  and when he reapparates three minutes later  i m in bed in our room  naked under the sheets  nerves aflutter  i ve cast a warming spell and lit a couple of candles on the table by the window  and when he ll shut the door behind him  that will activate the muffling spell i put in place  i ve modified it so that it s one-way  meaning we ll still be able to hear day in case he wakes up  everything is ready  draco is in the door  he has kind of stopped in his track the moment he spotted me in the bed  he s standing there  ten feet away from me  and it feels like a billion  because he s still got that flicker of insecurity in his eyes  and i want him with me  so much   darling   he says hoarsely   you sure you want to do this   so he s assuming that i want to talk now  discuss our fucked up couple history  maybe draw some more apologies from him  instead of going ahead as planned and lose my virginity  well  i do nt  and i ve decided to shelve my own apologies for ruining our first night out till later  much later   harry     of course i m sure  you moron   i say  - but then he shuts the door and steps forward into the room  and i get so nervous i feel like i might be sick  he steps up to the foot of the bed  for ten seconds or so  he just stands and looks down at me  eventually he puts a hand to his collar  loosening it like he needed more space to breathe  and then he starts unbuttoning his shirt  o god  he starts losing his clothes  but it is nt a striptease  it s a swift  low-key action  completely lacking in anything like showmanship  and then  for the first time  i get to see him with nothing on  the real draco  his hair is shadowing his chiseled features  but his body  kissed by the candlelight  is on full display  muscles softly shifting with his breathing  every line  every angle perfection  he does nt try to cover his erection  and he could nt  anyway  because it s just too large  it s every bit as magnificent as i remember it  i ve seen men with erect penises before  in porn  and i ve always found the aspect kind of awkward  like  hot  but not exactly graceful  but draco  god  wow  i could spend the next couple of hours just looking at him  it s actually what i d like best  just keep lying there  enjoy the view  and do nothing  but eventually i pull back the sheets  revealing myself to him  because it s obviously what he s been waiting for  and also for reasons of equity  i squirm under his swirling silver gaze  and he tells me i m the most beautiful man that ever walked the earth  i say the same to him  because it s the truth  but my voice is a shivering whisper  he smirks a little  making no move to join me  observing me  he says that s just how i feel because he s the first guy i ever took home from a night out  in spite of myself  i utter a small chuckle  moving over to the chair by the window and starting to leisurely drape his clothes over the backrest  he goes on poking fun at me  talking about how i was nt even half as innocent as i looked  what with putting my fingers in my arse while jerking off  and how this is his favourite wanking fantasy now  me on my bed in my plaid pyjamas  finger-fucking myself  i tell him i did it on my swivel chair when i was him  half naked  so i could see myself in the mirror on the door  and quite absurdly  i find that this conversation  that by any reckoning should be the most cringe-making in the history of romance  has suddenly made me feel much more at ease  shaking his head  tutting and calling me a little perv  he finally sits down on the bed next to me  i tell him to shut up or he might end up having to fuck himself  too  he lifts his hand and gently dabs at my lower lip with a finger tip and says that i m just proving his point with my dirty talking  and then we stop quipping  - he s so gentle with me  the hard lines of his face blurred by passion and love  his erection warm and firm against me  so real  i try to hide mine  turning onto my belly  foolishly  he moves me back around with strong  sinewy hands  exposing me  and he does nt laugh at my blush  which is fierce  his breathing is dry and fast  and his eyes burn  he s hovering over me  pressing up to me from the side  our bodies lined up  connecting  my scars touching his perfection  the caesarean scar is invisible  but the others  the old ones  stand out an angry red with my blood heated like it is  he puts his fingers on my chest  gently  gently  he strokes the skin between my scars  and then he strokes the scars  and in a small  still active corner of my brain i realize they ve stopped hurting to the touch  they are still there  the past is still what it was  but my scars have stopped hurting to the touch  without warning  he tweaks one of my nipples between his thumb and index finger  and i gasp out with the flash of pleasure zinging through me  and with the fact i m having my nipple being made stand out  but before i can die of shame  his hand moves to my hip  and lingers there for a few moments  then slides down to my arse  he palms the swell of my butt cheek  it feels obscene to even have a butt cheek  let alone having it caressed  and nothing is in my head anymore but that caress  his voice is ragged when he asks me how i want it  all i can do is hold on to his burning gaze  because my voice is gone  and because i do nt have a clue how i want it  he slides an arm under my neck  cradling my head against his shoulder  and his hand on my arse moves into my crack  and his eyes never leave mine  he spreads me open  fingers intruding  when he brushes against my entrance  the strangest sound breaks from my throat  and my body rocks into the touch  his smile is like a ghost of his nasty smirk  and it turns the hot flame in my groin to wildfire  twisting backwards to reach his wand on the nightstand  he conjures a condom and lube  tuned to my every emotion like he is  he instantly picks up on the renewed tension the mere sight of these objects elicits in me  cupping the back of my head in his palm and placing a chaste kiss on my forehead  he whispers a jagged explanation  he tells me there wo nt be any penetrating anytime soon  not until i m one hundred percent ready  but that he does nt intend to get me pregnant again just yet  and simply can not trust himself to keep protection in mind  he rolls on the condom  and i do nt know how such a mundane  sensible action can have such devastating effects on my ability to think  and then he empties the whole of the tube of lubricant into his palm with disconcerting purpose  sliding one hand back between my cheeks and wrapping the other round my startled  throbbing cock  but he does nt move his hands then  he just stays still like that for seven eternities  eyes closed  breathing hard  keeping my arse parted and holding my cock  and i spill precome over his fingers in endless ribbons of white  i realize i must nt be embarrassed about it  not at this point  but it s such a blatant proof of how i m losing control  and of how much i want him  it crosses my hazy mind that i should be doing something to him  too  but then his thumb strokes across my leaking tip  like finally answering its call for attention  and simultaneously he starts circling my entrance with a finger tip  swamped with heat  i spread my thighs to give him all the access i can  shame has stopped making sense  there is nothing but the crazy intense sensation of his touch  and then his finger slips inside me  and i yell out and come into his fist  i want to say sorry and joke about my blunder  but i just sob and grunt and fuck into his fist  my vision swimming  and he keeps both his hands on me  blissfully milking me and pushing into me from behind  till the end  afterwards  i clumsily scramble onto my knees and tell him to fuck me  and i suddenly realize i m madly afraid it ll hurt  he cradles my face in his hands and kisses me  taking his sweet  sweet time  and on breaking the kiss  he tells me this is not how we are going to do things  he says that this is not going to be about justice  or self sacrifice  i tell him i want him to fuck me  and i mean it  he cocks his head  appraising me  then smirks and says he ll take me up on that as soon as i m ready to go again  and that we ve got all the time in the world  he gets rid of the condom  it rips  because it s much too tight on his massive  jutting cock  sitting up  he puts his hand to my neck and guides my head down to his crotch  it s a move that s easy enough to understand  or it should be  but i only get what i m supposed to do when he says it  blow me  baby  his voice is deep with dominance and desire  feeling my arse give a twitch in response  i grab hold of his cock and heavy  swollen balls and start sucking on him  and although i do nt have anything like a technique  his breathing instantly becomes ragged and his cock thickens so much it must hurt  it makes me bolder  and i take advantage of the new possibilities of jerking off this delicious cock  enjoying to finally have it within reach of my mouth  i learn that the effects are way different when you tease a cock that actually belongs to another man  when i lick his slit  then let him slide in and out of my mouth full length  mimicking a fuck  his hand jerks to my butt  and he thrusts a finger in me  much less gently this time  he goes in deep  then adds another finger  stretching me  and his grip on my neck almost becomes too much  i start choking on his fat tip  and the same moment he arches his back and comes down my throat  crying out merlin s name  and mine  i recognize his taste  and i try to swallow everything  but he does nt stop  and in the end i have to opt for breathing  he plops from my lips  and his last shot hits my jaw and hair  slipping his fingers out of me  he exhales with a long shudder  my name is a sigh caressing my sweaty brow  and our eyes meet in a shaken  glorious moment  and then there is a screech from next door  so much for all the time in the world  hectically  haphazardly  we clean each other up  while day s crying turns to a frenzied shrieking  slipping into his dressing gown  draco tells me to stay put and that he got it  but i totter after him on naked feet  with a bed sheet wrapped around me  loath to allow even a few yards of distance between us  he says i m as stubborn as a garden gnome  and i retort that it would nt be fair if he did all the night shifts on his own just because he does the parental leave thing  on that  he gives me his softest  meanest-looking smile and says i love you  and skipping a heartbeat  i say  you  too  draco lifts day from his cot and tells him his dads are there and all is well  then summons the milk bottle he prepared earlier  day drinks his bottle in one go  ignoring draco s admonishing to take it slow  nestled against draco s shoulder  and gently hiccupping  he looks about with wide baby eyes  grabbing draco s hair and pulling  clearly having decided the night is over  he bites his little fist  and embarks on some more whining  and draco says it s teething and asks me to pop by at the potionary on my way home from college tomorrow and buy teething gel  i put it on my wand s errand list  marveling at the realization that i actually like running errands these days  i make a note to also buy some lube and condoms  then think of earlier  squirm a bit  and tell draco that i ll try to perform better next time  draco nods and says he ll teach me the ropes or maybe book a course for us  else we wo nt ever be able to let people watch  and when i stare he says  you were talking about dancing  were nt you  and he grants me the classic malfoy smirk  the next moment he cries out because day ripped a handful of hair from his scalp  and it s my turn to laugh  it s hard to stop laughing once i ve started  because of the debilitating sleep deficit i ve been accumulating over the last few weeks  it s the kind that only the parents of a newborn know  my ear itches  and i find a sticky spot of come there that we overlooked earlier  lazily removing it with cleansio  i lean back against day s abandoned bed  watching draco rock our son in his arms and sing that silly little tune  the malfoy nursery rhyme  and i understand that this is my life  and my soles are icy on the floor boards  and the fatigue creeps up on me full force  and the happiness is like a thousand golden suns dancing in my salvaged soul  thanks for reading  drop me a line if you like  feedback and reviews do make all the difference  cheers  crystal'],\n

with his wife ginny and they re soon to be daughter  ginny is the only survivor left from her family  ron  george  fred  molly  arthur and everyone else all died that night  the school took a beating  only a quarter of the school was left untouched  it took over a year to fix to its original state  out of the trio hermione was the only one to return to hogwarts for there final year  she was half way to the tower when she got out of her thoughts  she was nervous to confront him  even though they were on a friendlier term then before the war -LRB- saving his life from nagini s vicious bite -RRB- they had quietly come to a sort of truth per say  she was still the arrogant know-it-all to him  that would never change but now they could have conversations that did nt end up with someone s wand at either of their neck  she was now at the door to the tower  it s known to be haunted to every student here but all of hogwarts is haunted by some sort of type of ghost  she turned the doorknob to no avail  it was locked  she tried alohomora and any other unlocking charm she could think of  none of them worked  she took a deep breath and did the only other option that came to mind  knocking  she knocked lightly the first time  no answer  she knocked a second time but much harder  no answer  when she was about to give up she heard footsteps behind the door   professor it s me  hermione   the noised stopped  she closed her eyes in defeat and turned to go back when the door opened  she sighed and walked inside  it was very dark and dingy  there were a couple of steps to go up before reaching the tower s top completely  she slowly made her way up  as she was climbing the steps to the top the door closed quietly behind her and clicked  she felt the rush of charms being put up so no one could eavesdrop or just plainly walk in   professor   she called when she reached the top of the steps  he was sitting on a ledge in front of a memorial with a single white rose on top of it  she circled the memorial until she was beside severus  it was quite beautiful  white marble stone with a rose carved above the black writing  sara kirk august 12 th 1966 - may 26 th 1983 the love she shared  the hope she gave  the time she had  will always be remembered   sara   she stared at the memorial  everything clicking in her mind   may 26th  that s why you come down here every year  because of her   she sat down beside him  staring at his face  she noticed the tears that had fallen and been whipped off   professor   she called  no reply   severus   he turned his head to stare at her  his eyes showed so many emotions  some she never knew he was capable of  he was broken   is she the reason you come down here every year    yes   he said in a whisper   does this have something to do with the tragedy that happened sixteen years ago   he looked at her so confused  it was not well known that a tragedy had happened at hogwarts   how did you know about that  only the staff that was there remembers   she looked down too her feet  was she really the only one who knew  well she did nt know about it  she tried to find out but there was no record of the event   i do nt know what happened that night except for what is told on the memorial in the dungeon    it was destroyed during the war   he was now staring at the memorial   i know  when we were running to find the last horcrux we came across this room that none of us has ever seen before    it was charmed to be hidden   he interrupted  she stared at him for a moment before looking at the memorial   harry went off running as did ron but i stayed behind to look at it  five people were killed that night  all of them were slytherin s  i tried finding out what happened but there were no documents left after the war   almost all of the treasured books and documents were burned thanks to the bitch bellatrix who thought it would be beneficial when they won the war  well now she s dead and they lost   there were nt any documents   he never looked at her when he talked  he just kept staring at the memorial   why    everyone wanted to forget what happened miss granger   his voice was cracking a little  she noticed a couple of new tears fall down his cheek   if there were memorials in the school why was nt there a moment of silence every year  why forget about it    because we wanted to remember the ones who died but not remember what happened that night  it was hard having a moment of silence  after a while no one knew why and it was forgotten    except for you  you remember  why come here every year  from four till after midnight  what did she mean to you  if i m correct you started teaching around then  was she one of your students  was she a slytherin   she did nt mean to pry not one bit  she just wanted to know  to understand   so many questions miss granger    hermione  please  call me hermione    hermione   he repeated   i started teaching here in nineteen-seventy-eight  a year after she started going here    i thought you started when you asked dumbledore for help  in nineteen-eighty    those were the memories i gave to potter when i thought i was going to die   he stared at her  straight in her eyes  he looked a little betrayed that she looked at the memories that were for harry s eyes only   he wanted us too see them  i m sorry   she looked away from his stare  she felt ashamed that she trespassed on his memories   those memories i gave potter were given for a reason  to make him realize what he had to do    professor  what did sara mean to you   she knew she already asked him and he dodged the question but she was nt going to give up on knowing what happened  he stared at the memorial  flashback  everyone finish you last bit of ingredients and stirs and bottle your potion   severus stood in front of his sixth year class  he has been teaching the same students for five years now  four on his own without supervision  he was quite proud of his teachings  he was known as the bat of the dungeon  they feared him but knew his was a fair grader who did nt praise his slytherins like the other s did to there own house s  he treated them all like equals  he did hate gryffindor above all others and took as many points as he possibly could outside of class but inside he was fair  the class did as they were told and cleaned there tabled and left  they were always dismissed when they finished their potion  all of the students were far-gone except for one   shit   she swore   five points from gryffindor miss kirk for swearing   he walked towards her table and looked at her potion  she was a perfectionist and hated it when she got something wrong  she was always the last to leave  sadly severus was used to it now and tried to help her as much as he could to get her out   i m sorry sir   she took her ladle and poured her potion out and handed it to him   is it alright   she asked  she always asked   almost perfect   she smiled at him  took her bag and left  severus took the vial and placed it with the others  he sat down behind his desk and sighed  he changed  after lily was killed everything changed  he loved her to death  finding her dead was the worst thing that has ever happened to him  it s been a month since it s happened  his shell has become more and more thick  no one can see his true self  he now hides behind a mask of no emotions  he took his quill out and started marking all the potions made that day  end of flashback  so she was your student  a gryffindor   hermione looked at the memorial in wonder   yes  she was   flashback at dinner every night he looked out at the crowed of students sitting and enjoying there meal  his eyes lately looked down at the gryffindor table and looked at sara  she has been barley eating for a while now  a bite here and there but that was it  he noticed it started to get worse last year and told minerva  he got word the next day from her saying that she took care of it  apparently not  he had to talk to her  two days later when he had his sixth year class he waited patiently for his chance   everyone finish their potions and bottle them   he circled around to see sara bottling her potion on time  that ruined his plan of asking her when she stayed behind   miss kirk  please stay behind after class   he said without looking at her  there were snickers in the room but when everyone handed in their potion they all left  except for sara   you wanted to see me sir    yes please sit   he waved his hand and locked the door  he placed a couple of charms on the room so no one could over hear their conversation   sir   she looked panicked and scared  she started too look all over the room  it seemed like she was looking for an escape   miss kirk   she still looked panicked  what happened to make her like this  he stared at her for a moment before calling her name   sara   he said firmly  she snapped out of her panic a stared at him  she had daggers in her eyes   what do you want  i m going to be late for class    i will talk to your teacher explaining your absence    what do you want professor   he knew she was scared and he was going to find out why   i ve noticed that you have barley been eating  why is that   he looked at her concerned and her wall came straight up   its none of your business   she snapped  she stood up and ran for the door   unlock this door now   she yelled   no   he stood and stared at her   now   she commanded   ten points from gryffindor   he was hoping this would make her come back and sit   i do nt give a fuck about house points  let me out   she stared at him  he could tell that this was something more  the way she was standing  pulling her sleeves down  her head bent down  he waved his wand and stared at her in shock   you put a disillusionment charm on yourself   she looked up at him and touched her lip  her bruised  cut lip  her right eye was black and swollen as well as bruises on her neck   who did this   he took a step closer to her and she took one back  she was now against the door   please   she begged  tears were falling down her face  he took another step and another till he was only a foot in front of her  he grabbed her wrist and she started to pull away  tried to pull away  he pulled up her sleeve and held his breath   you re cutting yourself  what s going on   she tried to pull her wrist out of his grip but it was too strong   its none of your business   she spat at him  she was crying  hyperventilating   if not me then maybe professor dumbledore   her eyes grew wide   no  please no   all of a sudden she collapse in his arms  he caught her and fell to the floor with her while she cried  she broke down and for the life of him he could nt figure out why he was letting her break down in his arms  end of flashback  she broke down in my arms for hours before she fainted    did you bring her to the infirmary    no   flashback he picked her up in his arm and headed towards the hidden door in the classroom  he took the wards down and headed towards his private chambers  he opened the door to his bedroom and laid her down on his bed  he let go of her and started to walk out of the room when she started to cry in her sleep  he sat down beside her and lightly touched her shoulder  she stopped crying  he got up and went to leave again when she started to cry in her sleep once more  he turned towards her and sighed  he had no other choice  he climbed on the bed behind her and held her to his chest while she slept  something changed inside of him  suddenly lily started not to matter anymore  this right now  him holding sara felt  right  he closed his eyes and fell into a light slumber   where am i   she spoke weakly  he had been awake now for the past hour   in my chambers  i did nt think you wanted to go to the infirmary   he went to let go of her when she took his hand and held it in place  something sparked within him when she touched his hand  something he never felt before  not even with lily   i ca nt tell you what happened  what s happening  not now   she turned around to face him  his lips were only inches away from hers   but i will   he stared at her  he did nt know if she was telling the truth or not but for some reason he trusted her   just answer me this   she stared at him   does this have something to do with being muggle born   she took a sharp breath in   some of it  yes   her eyes showed how hurt  how battered she really was   sara   he could feel his magic as well as hers in the room  it felt like electricity  he closed his eyes and breathed in   severus   his eyes opened at the sound of his name  he knew she felt the same things he was feeling  she had too  he leaned forward and closed the gap between them and kissed her soft lips  it was shy at first but became more passionate  he climbed on top of her and kissed her more deeply  her hands ran in his hair holding on to him  making sure he was nt going to stop  he was nt  he kissed her till he needed to breath  he trailed kisses down to her neck and back up to her lips  her moans were heaven to his ears  her whispers of his name were orgasmic to him  he never wanted this moment to stop  end of flashback  wow   was all she could say  this was not the severus she knew   i thought lily was   she could nt finish her sentence  she did nt know anymore   the only one   he finished for her  she gave a small smile   she was  i still love her  that s why my patronus is still the same as lily s  i just love her like a sister  it started with that night    why give harry the memories of lily and not of sara    because he needed to know the truth of everything  to convince him to do what he had to do    oh   she stared at the memorial again   what happened after that   flashback  severus  severus  where are you my boy    not now old man   he grunted to himself   what s going   he put his finger on her bruised cut lip   shh  stay here i ll be right back  do nt make a sound   she nodded her head in agreement and leaned in to kiss his lips before he climbed off her and left the room  severus looked around for the old man but he was nt there   severus   he nearly had a heart attack  he forgot that he had agreed to have the floo linked to the headmaster s office   headmaster   he bowed his head in appreciation   my boy  i have come too see if you have heard the whereabouts of miss kirk  she did nt attend her last class and the students said you asked her to stay after class for a moment   severus looked like a fish out of water  he knew having sara in his chambers was wrong and knew the consequences that dumbledore could bestow upon him   professor i do nt feel so good   both severus and dumbledore turned towards the bedroom door too see a pale white sara   sara   dumbledore looked at her in shock over her beat up lip and eye  severus took a step closer to her when she threw up blood  he ran to her side and caught her when she fell   get poppy now   dumbledore was gone in a moment  severus picked up sara and took her to his bed once more  not a moment to soon poppy arrived with her bag and started working on her  severus helped as much as he could until poppy got sick of him and kicked him out  he waited in the living room quarters with dumbledore  finally after a good hour poppy came out looking like hell   she s fine   she said as she took a seat and a big gulp of the fire whiskey dumbledore handed to her   what was wrong   severus asked   many things   both men stared at her waiting for the explanation   well to start she had a black eye and swollen lip  easy fix  then it was her bruises on her neck and the rest of her body  they were healed quite easily  then there was the broken rib that puncher her right lung  that s why she vomited the blood and   she looked uncomfortable   say what needs to be said   dumbledore looked much older than he had ever seen  he was concerned  so was he   she was raped  multiple times  fed a sort of contraceptive potion that has almost killed her liver and the cuts on her    wrist   severus finished for her  dumbledore and poppy stared at him   i knew she was nt eating so i confronted her about it  found out that she had been beaten and that she has been cutting herself  she made it clear that she wanted no one to know   all three took a moment to take in all the information that had been shared   thank you poppy  is there any medicine that needs to be given    well yes  i want to take her to the infirmary right now    no   his voice was louder then he intended it to be   who ever is doing this to her goes here and we need to stop it  she promised she would tell me  give me some time with her   he knew he needed to do this  he did nt know completely why but he knew deep down he had to   i do nt think we want to keep her in a place were people can walk right in and out without being noticed  she might get attacked again    severus is right my lady  give severus all the potions he needs and let her stay here   severus could tell that poppy hated the idea but knew he was right  after a long pointless explanation on what to do with the potions she gave him  she left his chamber   my boy  she can have the rest of the week off of school  we will make it seem like she has gone home for a family emergency  she would have to stay here  you on the other hand will have to go to all your classes to not raise suspicion but are excused from meals  i will tell the staff you have a very important potion that needs all you attention  be careful my boy  your still hurting from lily  your judgment maybe cloudy   at that dumbledore left with a twinkle in his eye and severus knew that the old man was smart enough to figure out what happened between him and sara  end of flashback  if you knew it was wrong severus  why did you do it   she did nt mean to sound rude and hoped that severus did nt either  he looked at her with the most sincere eyes she has ever seen possible on one man   i was twenty-four when this started  i was young  in pain and felt something i ve never felt before  something i wanted to know   flashback he sat on his couch in front of the fire  a huge glass of fire whiskey in his hand  the thoughts that were going threw his head were  careless  stupidity  immaturity  loathing of himself  what he did was wrong and he knew it but he did nt know why  he wanted to know why  just her stare broke his mask  her need for him to hold her  to make her feel safe  he was more than a little intoxicated  he got up and walked towards his bedroom door  it was time to give the pain potion to her  he opened the door and his eyes grew wide  she was tossing and turning  silently yelling in her sleep in mid-air  everything in his room was floating four feet off the ground  he ran underneath sara who was now floating above the floor  the bed had floated off to the side of the room  he could nt reach her  he grabbed his wand but before he could say his spell a gut retching scream came from sara and she fell  everything in the room fell  he barely got underneath sara before she hit the ground  she was out cold  he picked her up and laid her down on the couch  what had just happened  this was odd  how much magic did she really have  hours passes before a sound came out of her  he sat at his chair that he loved to read at and waited for her to wake  he looked over his book with his hooked nose to see her starting to stir  she waved her hand and a glass of water appeared out of nowhere  he stared at her in wonder  wondless magic of this level  some simple spells yes  but making things appear out of nowhere   what happened   she asked after she took a sip of her water and sat up   you were ill  madame poppy came to heal you  you are dismissed from all your classes for the remainder of the week  according to dumbledore you will be staying here  the students and faculty will be notified that you have left for a family emergency   he tone was bare  he did nt know how to understand what happened  he lifted the book and continued to read  they both sat in silence for the rest of the night  end flashback  it was the same thing every night  her wandless magic was growing stronger but then halted when she started to talk about what was happening to her  her emotions controlled it  some she grasped but the rest was strong magic that she could nt control  every time she got upset you could feel it   hermione did nt hear the whisper of words he said after his last sentence   what type of magic was it   hermione knew the answer  if she was correct that meant   raw magic  only   hermione cut him off   three people in wizarding history were known to have it  it s rare and uncontrollable  if she had raw magic how was she a muggleborn   flashback it had been a couple of months since the night they kissed  her staying in his chambers for the week made there liking for each other bloom  understanding turned to liking  liking turned to friendship and friendship turned to love  they were together every night and no matter what tried there hardest to keep there newfound love  new found relationship a secret  they never did anything but kiss for the fear of dumbledore knowing and the rest of the school  he did nt mind  he wanted to wait  every night they would talk about what happened but he knew she was still hiding many things  she never once emitted she was raped and it worried him  he wanted to help but without her saying anything on the subject he could nt take any action  he found out a couple of weeks ago that she had what was called raw magic  it was extremely rare and dangerous  there was only one small section in a book in the restricted section of the library  the only known wizards who had this strong of magic died from losing themselves to it  it prevented him from reading her memories  the walls that she put up as well as her raw magic were strong and not even he could break them  they were sitting in front of his fireplace  her in his lap  both reading a book   what s that thing on your neck you keep doodling with   he asked without looking away from the sentence he read   oh this old thing  my mother said that my godmother gave it to me when i was born  i ve never met her in my life  she never once came to visit me after she gave me this   she held the pendent in the air to look at its elegance   it s a single white rose  my favorite flower out there  its pure and honest   she gave a soft sigh   severus    hm   he never took his eyes off his book   severus   she repeated   yes   he marked his page and placed the book on the mantle beside him   who got rid of my scars   she stared at the fire   what scares   he was actually confused  he had no idea what she was talking about   on my wrist  who spelled them off   she stared at her wrists  examining them   why   he turned her around to face him  she did nt respond   why   he said more firmly  she winced at the sound of his voice   never mind    tell me   if you ever knew severus you would know how much his blood was boiling at this point   i  i  she stuttered   tell  me   his eyes were harsh and he knew it but he also knew he needed to be so she would talk   they had no right  they were my scares  no one had a right to take them away from me   she was standing in front of him yelling  tears falling from her eye  the room started to shake  her eyes turned completely black  her raw magic came out  he knew she was hiding this to the point it boiled over  he could nt take it  he now knew that most of the things she told him were a lie  just from this  he did nt have the patience anymore for her  for the lies  he tried every night   get out   he said in defeat   fine   at that she was gone  it was for the best  it had to be  end flashback severus stood for the first time and looked out the tower to the water   it did nt last long  she came back    severus i   flashback it was the day before school ended for the summer  all the students and staff were all gallivanting about what there plans were  where they were going all except severus  he stayed to himself in his dungeon  that was his plan for the summer  he was allowed to stay as long as he wished  he was behind on potions that needed to be brewed for the infirmaries all over england  since the downfall of the dark lord he now had time for his duties that were pushed down on his list of things to do  he was in a deep concentration when the door knocked   come in   his eyes never left his potion   hi   his head snapped up too see sara standing at his door   um  can we talk   he looked back down at his potion  he never expected her to come back  he made it quite clear in his letter to her  she took his silence as a yes   severus i    professor snape   he cut in  she gave him an odd stare even though he did nt see it   i  look everything that happened is something i m still trying to deal with  i told you what i could but every ten seconds you would try to read my mind and    i only did that because you refused to tell me the truth  you lied to me   he placed his potion in the vial and spelled the table clean   look at me severus and do nt give me that professor bullshit   she walked to the table he was standing at  every emotion he felt for her came back  she was so close to him  in every class she was in he kept his distance from here  he did nt want to be near her for the fear of this   then tell me the truth  what happened to you  do nt lie because you will leave the instant you do   this was her last chance  she took a deep breath and sighed   i was bullied when i first came here  small things that meant nothing  name calling and all those things  in my second year i got raped for the very first time  there were two of them in there third or fourth year  they said if i ever mentioned anything they would use an unforgivable on me so i stayed quiet  i was twelve severus  twelve   he never once thought that this happened to her that young  that was the year he started teaching and he never once noticed   i hid everything quit well  no one knew  it continued  after a while i became a pro a brewing a contraceptive potion out of the things i could find in the forest   she sat down on the bench in front of her  he stood in the same spot   that summer i found that i had magic that was stronger then everyone else s when i was mad at my parents and made a toy appear out of nowhere with my hands  i was so scared that the school would find out so i kept it a secret  i was bullied so much during the summer that i wanted to come back  hogwarts ironically is my home  my save haven  the first couple of months back were fine until they found me  i was hiding so well    do you know who these two are   he would find them and give them an unforgivable for there money   no  they hid their faces  house and voices well   he was disappointed  if he ever found out who they were he would kill them   the beatings started this year  out of the blue they got sick of raping me so they beat me  when you took my delusionment charm off you saw the worst that they ever gave me   tears were falling down her cheeks and all severus wanted to do was wipe them off but he could nt  he needed to hear everything   how come you did nt scream or defend yourself   he knew she was under a spell   they put a lot of spell on me  i could nt scream  move or sometimes even breath if they felt like it  i felt my magic boil inside of me but i would nt let it out  i was scared of what would happen   severus walked around the table until he was in front of sara   i love you sara kirk and i will do everything in my power to find them and keep you safe   he wiped the tears off her cheeks and kissed her lips  her hands went to the back of his neck  at that moment severus let everything out  there kiss sent shivers down his spine  he felt his need for her as his cock pressed against his pants  he took his hands and trailed them down to sara s lower back and lifted her up to the table  she moaned with pleasure when he started to kiss and nip and her neck  he hands were all over her body taking her cloths off  after a minute or two she was almost completely bare except for her nickers and bra  she tried her hardest to take his top off but became frustrated with all the buttons and waved her hand to have him completely naked  he laughed for the first time in ages   my  my severus i never knew you were capable of laughing   the smile on her face just made everything worth it  he made love to her for the very first time  the feel of inside of her  the feel of her skin underneath his  her breath on his lips  her moans  her cries of his name with hers when they climaxed were all bittersweet to him  he climbed off of her and started to dress  as did she   severus    yes    can i show you something   he walked to her and held her in his arms   show me what    a place i go when i m scared or when i m hiding   he stared at her and kissed her forehead   oh course   she took his hand and led him out of his private potions lab  end of flashback  she took me here  it was the first time i ever stepped foot in this tower  i knew it was forbidden when i was a student here   he was still standing and staring at the water  hermione got up and stood beside him  they both stood in silence for a while   we made a promise that night to wright to each other every other night  so she went home  she wrote to me every other night  i kept my promise   flashback dear severus  i hate it here so much  i want to be back to hogwarts with you  reading a book in front of the fire  everyone here thinks i m a  hag  as they say  i m glad you got caught up in your potions  i miss you and love you so much  sara  ps is their any other way to send mail besides an owl  people are getting a little suspicious  he hated to admit it but he loved getting her letters  it was the last one she sent  he had read the same letter for over two weeks now and was getting worried  he sent her many but never got any in return  tonight he was going to find out why  in one of her first letters she sent she said were she lived  she wanted him to come down to visit and get a drink or two with her  he simply would nt go for the fact that he hatted muggle clothing  now he was going to have to bear it  something was wrong  very wrong  he could feel it  he walked to the edge of the forbidden forest and aperated to a little town near london  it was a rare sunny day  there were kids running all around  playing with there friends  people mowing their lawn  cleaning anything they could find on their property  some stared and the rest just did nt notice him  he was near her house  only a couple of blocks away  there was an alleyway right across her house  there were teenagers standing there all passing around something that smelled a little funny  he thought briefly about when sara talked about the people who bullied her and thought they were them  his hand was on his wand in his pocket  he wanted to hex them but stopped for the fear that they were nt  he crossed the street and walked on the lawn to sara s door  he knocked   just a minute   he heard from the other side of the door  a young lady with long blond hair and a very thin frame opened the door  she stared at him oddly before greeting him   hello  may i help you   she said with a huge smile on her face  he gave a slight nod of his head   yes i was wondering if you were the mother of sara kirk    yes i am  may i help you   she asked   yes  i am a teacher at hogwarts and would like to talk to you about how she is doing in her classes   her face expression changed a little   oh yes  come in and sit down ill get us some tea   he walked inside and she closed the door behind him   who was that dear   he heard a man yell from upstairs   oh sweetie please come down  a teacher from sara s school is here to talk to us    oh  be down in a minute   she gave severus a small smile   oh what s your name   she asked   severus  severus snape   he gave her another nod and she smiled   ill be right back with some tea   she turned around and left the living room  he sat down on the white couch that faced the dining room  the house was very  girly to say the least  there were no dark colors to be seen at all  it was all pink and white pastels with hints of other colors now and then  in the middle of the coffee table was a vase with a single white rose in it  he smiled and thought of sara and the night she explained why she wore that necklace all the time and then frowned at the fight that happened afterwards   sugar  milk   she asked smiling as she handed him a cup   no thank you   he replied  a moment later a man came down the stares and sat on the couch facing the front window with his wife   any news   he asked severus   pardon   he asked in confusion   do you know were sara is   he stared at the man and looked to the women  she looked at severus and understood   you do nt know  dear   she took a sip of her tea and placed the cup on the coffee table   she ran away about two weeks ago now  i was hoping she ran away to her school  that s what i thought when you arrived  to tell us she was ok   he knew something was wrong and he was right  the man and woman stared at each other for a moment   see she s not our biological daughter   the man said  severus stared at him  this made no sense at all that it made sense   but she is our daughter  she will always be   she said with a hint of sadness in her voice   what happened   he asked  he was starting to panic  he knew something was wrong  he had to find out what happened  she took another sip of her tea and held it in her hands  hey eyes were fixed on the cup   a little over two weeks now she came downstairs asking us what we were hiding from her  we never could keep a lie  she always knew  so we sat her down and explained   her husband was rubbing circles on her back   one night a young girl came knocking on our door  no older than seventeen  it was raining so we let her in  she looked panicked  she kept mumbling about a war and that death was soon coming  we tried to calm her down when she waved a stick and a baby appeared in her arms  we did nt know what to think and we got scared  she calmed down and smiled at her baby  her baby that she named sara  she explained that she was a witch  a good witch and that there were evil forces after her  a man who she did nt want to name was in control  that he wanted to control all the wizards and witches in the wizarding world  she said she had been watching us for a while and that she knew we were trying to adopt  she handed sara to us and said that she would be back by her fourth year of school  she gave us this odd looking money and said it would pay for her first four years  the only other thing she explained was that when sara turned eleven she would receive a letter to a magical school named hogwarts  we were confused out of our minds and scared  then out of nowhere she disappeared and there was a loud popping sound  the only things she left for sara was a necklace with a single white rose on it  she never came back   it all made sense to him now  sara s powers  it was impossible for her to be muggleborn and have raw magic  that would mean her mother was powerful  but who was she   and you never heard from her again   he asked   no  we told sara this and she ran upstairs  we thought she was just mad until we heard a loud popping sound like the night her mother left  we ran upstairs and she was gone  all her things were packed and gone   she was in tears now   i think she went to go look for her mother  we love her  we always will  she is our daughter   end of flashback hermione was in shock to say the least  she leaned against the wall and fell to the ground  she was mentally exhausted from everything she heard  she never knew this side of severus  never  severus still stood  never taking his eyes off the water   i went looking for her  weeks passed by and no one had seen her  i went to dumbledore and told him the news  he knew   flashback he was worried  he looked everywhere for her  he even tried to find her mother to no avail  the students were arriving in twenty minutes and he prayed that sara was on that train  he missed her  he needed to see her to make sure she was ok  he sat at the head table when the students started to come in and sit at there usual spots  there she was  he smiled like never before  which caught the attention of many slytherins and staff but that smile turned into a frown just as fast  something was wrong  she always looked up at him  she did nt this time  he watched her threw the whole sorting ceremony and dinner  she was gone before everyone else  not eating a bite of her food  he left his table and went to his chamber and sat there in front of the fire  fire whiskey in hand wishing sara was sitting in his lap reading a book  the next day dumbledore informed him that sara had dropped out of potions due to the fact that she had gone to the ministry during the summer explaining that she felt no need to take the class during her last year  they agreed  due to her grades and let her take her newts in advance  severus could not even explain the emotions he was feeling  he was sad but most of all he was angry  angry at her  angry that she was not eating again and just fucking angry that she no longer wanted to see him  he sent her many owls and watched while she received them  she ripped the up and placed them in her pocket to dispose of later he guessed  his walk down to his classroom was vicious  anyone in his way were sure to get his rage on them  more than many points were taken from every house  even slytherin   turn to page 47 and do the potion  you have exactly one hour  if it is not done in time you will be serving detention with filch   he said with venom  they all scrambled to get their potion done  he knew he was being harsh but at this point he did nt give two fucks  months went by and they did nt talk  he noticed she changed  her style  her attitude  there was a staff meeting just about her  every teacher noticed her change in attitude  in everything  she was failing almost every class and she seemed to not care  she was never seen out anymore  her very few friends were no longer around and she was barely seen by any  it was now may and she would be taking her newts in two weeks  he needed to talk to her and he needed to do it now  he planed everything in his head  how to get her to meet up with him  to talk to him  it truly was a very good plan  he put out the fire and went to bed  tomorrow on may 26th he would confront her once and for all  end of flashback hermione held her legs to her chest  so much information was given in the last six hours  tears were falling down her face  she was scared to figure out the rest but she needed to know   do you want to know the rest   he asked barley over a whisper   yes   flashback it was the day he would talk to her  he was in his private chambers  everyone was about to leave for lunch when he called his elf   yes master snape   the elf smiled   yes dandy  could you please put this on the plate of sara kirk for lunch when she arrives   he handed dandy the note   yes master   she replied and popped out of the room  now all he had to do was wait in his private potions room  to contrary belief he never changed his password to get inside  just so sara could come and go when she pleased  it was now fifteen past three and his hopes went down  she was supposed to be here at three sharp  he sign and went to leave when he looked up too see sara standing in the doorway  his heart skipped a beat at seeing her but also broke   hello   he said very quietly  he wanted to hold her but was scared that she would leave do to the fact that he took a step towards her  she took one back   you wanted to see me   she asked   yes  sara i   he had his speech all planed but it all went out the door when he looked at her  he was speechless   look sir  i really do nt want to be here  so if you please can hurry it up it would be appreciated   had he just been slapped  it felt like it to him  his mouth was open like a fish out of water   sara   she would nt look at him   what happened  you stopped writing to me  i went to your parents sara  i know you were adopted   to say she snapped was an understatement   fuck you severus  you had no right to go to that house and talk to those fucking liars    no right  your joking are you  you stopped replying  all my letters came back  i was worried sara  i m sorry for bloody loving you   he yelled  his magic was starting to boil form his anger  he was worried of what her magic was like at this moment   bloody hell you love me  guess what i did this summer severus  i went to go find my mother and i did  guess where she lives  in a grave  a fucking grave    sara i m so sorry   he never knew  he did nt  suddenly all he wanted to do was hold her  make her feel better   do nt start that  i m sorry  bullshit  you killed her   he stared  that was all he could do  he was confused   yea severus you and your death eater friends  that s what the mark on your wrist is for is nt it  to be called like a dog whenever voldemort wants you to kill someone   he stood there  nothing could mask the shock of her words on his face   i asked around and they said they noticed you and three others killing my mother  does it click anything in your mind severus  godric hollows  two months before the fall of voldemort  a small beat down house with a woman who was trying to get her daughter back   there was no love in her voice  she hated him  he knew it  and it came to him  that woman begging for her life  saying she did nt want to die she wanted to see her daughter  it was one of voldemort s torture nights and severus was the ginny pig  the cruciatus curse was places on him repeatedly and then  when voldemort was tired with that he sent him with three other death eaters to go kill a woman who told secrets that were heard and said to others to try to save there lives from voldemort s evil  they raped and brutally killed her  severus never wanted to be apart of that night but the three other death eaters forced him to do it  one way or another  he snapped out of his flashback when he noticed all his potion vials and ingredient were shaking   sara  calm your magic   he said calmly but sturdy  he needed to calm her down now   fuck you snape  i found out who you truly where this summer  was being with me a thrill for you  making love to me remind you fucking my mother and killing her  was it a sick replay for you  did everything i tell you ended up being a laugh with your friends because of how stupid i was  trusting you and believing you truly loved me  huh  tell me severus   her magic was now out of control  the whole room was shaking  he almost fell to the floor but stayed up straight to defend himself if her magic got even more out of hand   i hate you severus snape  your nothing but trash and a distant memory of mine   there were daggers in her eyes  there were daggers in his   what the hell sara  do you honestly think that  i never meant to kill your mother  i was forced to sara  if i could change it i would but at that time i had to  i had to make sure someone else was safe  i did nt know she was your mother  i would nt have if i did   at that ever single vial in the room shattered into oblivion  every potion ingredient was thrown across the room  her eyes were not her own  her magic took over  her eyes were fully black  no more of the beautiful brown colour they were  just black  she was possessed by her magic  she lifted her hands and severus flew to the wall  in a blink of an eye she was in front of him  holding him to the wall with her magic  everything in the room was floating  all the glass  water and ingredients  in a deep voice that was not her own she said   listen to me severus  you are pathetic  you are a murderer and i will never forgive you  you killed my mother and many others  you do nt deserve to live   and at that she was gone  a few minutes later his restraint was released and he fell to the floor  everything fell to the floor with a loud thud and crashing sound  he fell in a hole  was that all she thought of him now  he loved her  he did  she had helped him threw a lot  he owed her his life for just that  she stole his heart that belonged to lily  a heart that was broken  he sat on the floor and tears fell down his long hooked nose  he needed to go for a walk  he stood up and let his hair fall in front of his face  he needed to hide himself from everyone  he was walking down the hall in the dungeons when he noticed melisa fraise running down the hall screaming   help  professor  help  please help   he caught her and she was crying   there dead  there all dead   she was mumbling while crying   who  what  melisa stop and breath   he said while he shook her  she nodded her head and took a breath   there dead  all of them   he stared at her   show me   he said  they both ran to the scene  and what he saw was gruesome to say the least  they were all torn to shreds  all of them  mark  charles  dracule  george and allen  they were all dead  the blood that were splashed on the walls  the ceiling  their corpses all over the room  it was horrid  his foot was beside the decapitated head of mark  he stared at the room  at the boys in shock  he had a feeling who did this and was scared to ask  he waved his wand and sent a patronus to dumbledore notifying him of what just happened   who did this   he asked melisa  she was staring at the scene before her  all the blood  and all the bodies   melisa   he screamed  she snapped back to this world and looked at him  she whispered one word that made him turned pale   sara   he ran  he knew were she went and he ran straight for it  he ran into students and teachers and pushed them all out of his way  he did nt care  he needed to get to her  his gut was telling him something was wrong and he did nt like it  he ran as fast as he could to the forbidden tower  that s were she went  that s were she always went  end of flashback severus sat back down in front of the memorial  he looked tired   i do nt think i can tell you the rest   hermione looked at the back of his head  she was tired   i ve never told anyone what happened next   he said as he turned his head to look at her  tears were falling down his hooked nose  she crawled to him and whipped them away   you do nt have to if you do nt want to   she said  it was up to him and how much he truly trusted her   ill keep it a secret if you do   she sat down beside him and stared into his eyes  he nodded  flashback he finally reached the forbidden tower  he went to open the door but it would not budge  every spell he tried did not work  he did the only thing he thought of and that was bagging on the door   sara please  open the door i know you re in there  please  sara   he kept bagging and banging  screaming her name  ten minutes later the door clicked  he stared at the door nob and turned it  the door opened and dread filled up inside of him  he ran up the stares to find sara on the floor  blood spilling from her wrist  he ran to her and held her on his knees  in his arms   sara  wake up  sara   he was full out crying  he needed to snap out of it to help her  he held her head to his ear and heard her still breathing  it was soft but it was there   sara   he yelled  her eyes fluttered open just a little   severus   she said  her voice was raspy   shh  shh  i m going to heal you sara  i m going to make this all better   he said   it wo nt work   she gave a small smile   i spelled it not too heal   he stared at her but did nt listen  he took his wand out and tried every single healing spell he knew  even some he created  none of them worked   sara please  take the spell off   he begged her   please   she lifted her hand and placed it on his cheek   i cant severus and you know it  i m too strong  i killed them severus  i killed them  all five of them  they cornered me  like the ones before  my magic was too strong and i killed them  i did nt realize it till after it happened  a girl screamed and i snapped out of it  they did nt deserve it but my magic was too strong   she mumbled  tears were falling down her cheeks  he took his hand and whipped them away  he knew she was right  her magic was too strong but he did nt care  he needed her to live  not just for him  but also for everyone else  she was a strong  smart woman who would accomplish anything she put her mind to   ill help you learn to control it sara  please take the spell off so i can heal you   he cried  she smiled at him  she was getting colder  he knew there was nt much time  he needed her to change her mind  she needed to live   i m sorry for what i said to you severus  i know you re not that man  you did what you had to  it was all for a good reason   her hand was still on his cheek  she moved it to the back of his neck and pulled him an inch away from her face   i love you severus snape   she said as she pulled him down to kiss him  her lips were cold and blue  the kissed lasted only a moment but felt like an eternity that ended too fast  her hand fell and she took her last breath  she was dead  he shook her  tried spells  he even tried cpr but nothing work so he held her  he just held her   i love you sara  i love you so much   he whispered in her hair  he held her till way after midnight when dumbledore and everyone else finally found them  they all stared in shock to see severus staring into nothingness  holding a dead sara in his arms  all the blood that came from her wrist was dried to him  to the floor  they tried pulling him away but he would nt let go  he would never let go  he woke up the next day in the infirmary  he was put under a sleeping spell so he would let go of sara  his classes as well as every other class was canceled for a week to attend the funerals of the people they lost that night  sara s was the last and the only one he paid any attention too  dumbledore set up two memorials  one were the five slytherins died and one were sara passed away  after her death severus was different  he had no emotions left in him  he was depressed  he often spent nights drugged on dreamless sleep potion to the point that he was addicted to it  he dreamt of her often and spent many nights in front of the fire with a box in his hands  every letter  picture they took was placed in the box  even the book sara never finished was placed there  it had been year since her death  he sat in his chair with a blank expression on his face when his owl came with a letter and a small box  he gave his owl a treat and she left  he did nt want to open the letter at all  he did nt want to hear from anyone  he just wanted to sit and stare at the fire  it took him a while to open it  dear severus snape  i do nt know if you remember me but you came to our house during the summer that sara went missing  it took me a while to realize this but you were the one she always talked about  wrote to every day  sara loved you so much  dumbledore told me you tried to save her life and i thank you so much for that  we loved her so much just as you  i know it s been a year since it happened but i thought i should give you this  i ca nt keep it and i know deep down sara would want you to have this  it meant a lot to her and i know it will mean a lot to you  it s been a long and hard year for us  i know its been just as hard for you but never forget the smile she always gave to the ones she loved  the laugh that she shared to only a few and her love  the letter was nt signed by anyone but he knew it was from sara s mother  he read the letter once more and placed it in the box  he looked at the small box that came with the letter and opened it  his eyes filled with tears  it was her necklace  a single white rose on a silver chain  he held in in his hand and held it close to his heart  he got up and left his private chamber  he walked up to the forbidden tower were her memorial laid  he had nt visited this place since that night  he locked the door and summoned a white rose out of nowhere  he walked up to her memorial and placed the single white rose on top of it   hi   he said   i ve never been up here since that night   tears were falling freely down his face   i miss you so much   and at that he broke down  he laid down in front of the memorial holding the single white rose pendant in his hands and cried  end of flashback hermione was in tears  everything she was told  sara   i still keep her necklace in the box  i look at it when ever i miss her   he took his hand and kissed his fingers and placed his fingers on the memorial   goodnight hermione   he waved his wand and all the spells to keep the privacy was gone  he left the room without another word  she watched him leave  she turned her head to the memorial once more and waved her wand  a single white rose appeared on top of the one severus left  she kneeled in front of the memorial   you loved him so much   she whispered to no one  she whipped away the tears that fell and got up  tonight she swore to herself that every year from now on she would come back on may 26th to remember the memory of sara kirk and what she went threw  to be they re for severus no matter what  tonight she learned a new side of him  one she never even knew existed  tonight she changed  the end an  hey guys  hope you like it  r  r tell me what you think  this took me two weeks to wright so i really hope you guys liked it ',\n        'we had spent our summer at the burrow  ron  hermione  myself  and ginny  and had been exploring some of the less obvious secrets of the surrounding land  at one point  we found an old abandoned muggle church  at the bottom of a great gaping gorge  when we finally decided to explore it  we flew down into the gorge on the weasley s personal brooms  when we got to the bottom  i began hearing whispers of a long forgotten conversation  a conversation held my first year  three years ago  before an object of unholy power was destroyed forever  or so i thought  i began making my way around the perimeter of the building  listening  once i was fairly sure of where the noise was coming from  i aimed a blasting curse at the stones  and found a hollow place in the wall  i muttered  why is this here    lumos   i whispered  and lit up the hollow  there  sitting in a back corner  was a blood red stone  with an ancient flame burning at it s center   guys  come take a look at this   they came from having been walking around  enjoying the scenery  and hunting for secrets on their own  apparently  they had also been talking about their mother  forbidding us from coming anywhere near this church was a slight bit suspicious  if you asked me then  now  with what i had just found again  that question had been answered  but twelve more had been asked  one by one  they looked into the hollow  and asked what it was   a relic  last seen our first year   hermione  genius that she was  understood first   the stone   aye  the philosopher s stone  the only questions now  are why it s here  why did they claim it had been destroyed  and why did molly forbid us from coming here   ginny spoke  she could nt have known that it was here  could she   speak of the devil  and he shall appear  is an excellent phrase to use here  as molly had just touched down in the ruins  looking furious   i told you four to never come here  you ve been meddling in my plans far too long  young man  now i m going to have to make sure you never do so again  she shrieked  an unholy sound  to be sure  the four of us were utterly confused  her plans  what plans  i snapped my head around  just in time to see a cutting curse coming towards my legs  i jumped to avoid it  but she just kept casting  a true bombardment of spells  and not all of them spells that would be expected from a light witch  such as herself  i dodged to the best of my ability  and shielded the rest of the time  in her rage  she made one fatal mistake  there are four of us  and she completely forgot about the other three  hermione hit her with a full body bind curse  ginny with a bat bogey hex  and ron with a slug expelling jinx  i stunned her for good measure  and took her wand  we noticed a bench  a small metal affair  nothing fancy  but we tied her up with  incarcerous   woke her up  and released our other spells  almost immediately  she started in on her rant  so i did the only thing i could think of  i smacked her  she looked so shocked  then became furious  somehow  she managed to unbind herself  then reclaim her wand  and turned it on me   imperio  she yelled  a calming feeling washed over me  and a small voice in the back of my mind whispered  take out your friends  then submit to me   i denied her  but she kept trying  i denied her three times  before i threw off the curse  i reached out  wrapped my hand around her neck  and held her by the throat   did nt you know that the  imperius  does nt work on me  alastor moody found that out  or rather  bartemius crouch jr did  while he was polyjuiced to look like him   crucio   i could feel the pain  but it was nowhere near as bad as my own   crucio  i murmured  she screamed as though she were burning alive in the rings of the inferno   what were your plans   i asked  you were supposed to be weak  stupid  and loyal   she replied  she flinched everytime i raised my wand   and  what of the stone   i questioned  it was supposed to keep me young and beautiful  she said  arrogance clear in her tone   you just cost yourself that  now  let s see if you can do the same thing i managed  at one year old  avada_kedavra  i said  voice growing louder  the tell-tale green light lighting up her face  hitting her  accepting her  splitting her soul from the body  she was dead  and all plans  were gone ',\n        'calling this night hot would be a massive understatement  it was boiling  lily was sure the turnips she left in the kitchen to cook overnight for her potions lesson might as well have been left outside  this week - as her parents had kindly warned her beforehand - would be the hottest week in five years  the head-girl of hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry  lily evans  was doing her monthly duty of patrolling the school corridors until three  it was currently eleven and this was the fifth time she d cast a cold-air charm to stop herself from melting to death  usually  lily enjoyed patrolling the corridors because it was a time for her to clear her head  however recently there s only one thing she s been able to think about  james potter  it was her pleasure to think about him because he was her friend  if only she actually thought of him as one  every time she d walk past sir bredly of birmingham s portrait she d look at his messy hair and think about james s and how his would never settle  then she d imagine how it could look after she d kiss him  she thought about how she wanted to be the only one he d ever touch and kiss  even though that would be highly unlikely  before  all these feelings confused her  now  they angered her  they make her feel as though she could nt control herself  after all  he was only a seventeen-year-old boy  as lily was just about to turn into another corridor she heard someone from behind her shout   who in the name of merlin s massive right nostril would be stupid enough to sneak out of bed in this weather   lily pressed her lips together to prevent herself from snorting out-loud and turned around to face james potter  the attractive -LRB- or handsome though she d never admit it out loud -RRB- head-boy   oh  he muttered   lumos   james  wand lit up  earning a few groans from the portraits hung around the corridor and an involuntary gasp from lily  who was now staring at his naked torso   why are you naked   she demanded   i m not  i m shirtless  i d be roasting to death with my shirt on  why are you patrolling my section of the castle   he asked  she took her eyes off of james s body and looked around  noticing it was the third floor  she was supposed to be patrolling floors five to seven   sorry  i did nt realise  she wiped some sweat off her forehead with the back of her hand   it s just so hot  god  i feel like i m in fat aunt sallie s sauna   she cast another cold-air charm and noticed james frown   it s a room full of steam   james raised his eyebrows as if to say  oh  but was obviously still very confused  lily s eyes drifted downwards again towards james s perfectly toned torso  she tried to be discreet but she could nt stop herself from glancing at it  his body was perfect and she was only staring at half of it  even though she d seen him topless many times after quidditch matches  she had never seen him this close  especially not in the state he was in now  wet with sweat  this new attitude she had accustomed herself to infuriated her  she was acting like one of those silly fourth year girls who fawned over him every time he was nearby  although  there was a time he walked past her and she could feel his scent slide up her spine and wrap itself around her neck  she remembered how it made her shiver and how she had to walk out of the great hall because she was paranoid about anyone having seen her  james potter was making her go crazy  the sound of his steps towards her snapped her back to reality  as he was walking she noticed how his wand light emphasised his facial features - his green eyes  his strong jawline  the sharp  v  between his top lip  the subtle dent in between his eyebrows  after he d reached her he continued walking so she followed him and they walked together   have you got your ingredients prepared for potions tomorrow   he asked her while wiping the sweat off of himself with the shirt he d taken off   yes  kind-of   he raised his eyebrows and said   i do nt think i ve ever finished my potions homework before you in all the seven years we ve spent together in this school  especially not easy homework like preparing ingredients for brewing  he laughed quietly and shoved his fist in the air as a gesture of triumph  lily felt that familiar sensation of something crawling up her spine again  only this time it was caused by his voice   no  i have finished it  she retorted  smiling   my turnips are boiling in the kitchens and when they re done geen said he d take them up to my room for me   james suddenly halted  his hands dramatically flew together over his heart as he gasped loudly   you re boiling your turnips in the kitchens   she turned to face him and saw him compose himself in the clear intention of mimicking her  his left arm on his hip and the right positioned like the spout of a tea-pot  she rolled her eyes when he began speaking in a very high-pitched bossy tone   lily evans  how many times do i have to tell you  you re a head-girl  you re supposed to set an example  you ca nt go sneaking around the castle every two weeks  making friends with peeves and the house-elfs  you re seventeen for -- what s that thing you say  oh  -- for heaven s sake   they both looked at each other for about three seconds and then burst out laughing   lily evans and james potter  are you planning to wake up the whole castle   the laughing ceased immediately and they turned to face mcgonagall  who was fuming  she marched towards them with her wand held up high and giving off light   put your shirt back on  potter   lily heard him shuffling the shirt back on   i was trying to find you two to tell you to go back to bed because it s far too hot to be patrolling the castle but evidently you seem to be having a good time   mcgonagall paused  this made lily only more ashamed   do you think your patrolling duties are set up so you can join hands and have a grannies meeting   mcgonagall glared at them  her lips set in a straight line  lily was nt able to maintain eye contact with her so she looked down   ten points will be taken from gryffindor each for misbehaving  patrol the corridors for an extra hour then go back to bed   she turned to face lily   and go back up to your floors  miss evans   as mcgonagall walked off they could hear her muttering   can not believe i just had to deduct points off my own house because of the head girl and boy  ridiculous  then she was gone  lily  who hardly ever got shouted at  was left with a red face  james took his drenched shirt back off and she tried her best to fix her eyes on the portrait behind him   i m going to go back up  she whispered  conscious about being heard again and started to walk off   wait  he said  hesitantly  he grabbed her wrist and she felt his sweaty hand  this would have put many girls off of the hogwarts heart-throb but instead it made her ache for him  never had she wanted his hands on her more than she did right now  she wanted him to take her shirt off  to press their bodies together in this unendurable heat and to smell like his sweat  oh god  she thought  and cast another cold-air charm  it s just the heat  she thought again  the heat is making me mental   i ve -- uh  i ve been meaning to ask you something   he said and she grit her teeth together in the feeling of déjà vu  this reminded her of how james used to act however he had nt asked her out since sixth year  at first  she felt peaceful and content without him annoying her every other hour but after only a week she d strangely begun missing his constant nagging  and now  ever since their seventh year stared lily had begun craving him  during lessons  she d find herself staring at him - whether he was in-front of her and she was staring at the back of his head or he was next to her and she was staring at the way his fingers held his quill  while she d been doing her homework  she d found herself wishing he was there to play with her hair and to relax her  whenever they d find themselves sitting opposite each other in the great hall  she d always been so tempted to just lean across the table and snog him  she wanted him to grab her and push her against a wall like she d seen tom haddorty do to mary   yes   she asked  noticing the corridor returning to its hot state   yeah -- well  you know  this is our last month and our exams are over soon so  i mean you do nt have to and you know --   he wants to ask you on a ruddy date  stop mumblin  and get to the point quicker  son  we want to sleep   barked a portrait to lily s left  james blushed and nodded  she d never seen james blush  she loved it  for her  that was it  she grabbed james by his neck  pulled him towards her and kissed him with all the passion she could muster  he dropped his wand and the light went out  when his lips moved with lily s she could feel her lips tingle with pleasure and her insides exploding  she could finally feel his lips against hers  his breath around her mouth  in her mouth  their tongues touching  he ran his along her bottom lip before kissing her again  within seconds she gave into temptation and reached out her hand to stroke his firm abs  james separated their lips but kept their foreheads touching   i m hoping this is a yes   he asked smiling  lily was grateful he could nt see her face in the dark as she was smiling stupidly   of course it s a yes  she replied   why did you kiss me    because you - because you ve been driving me absolutely nuts  ever since you ve started ignoring me and talking to me normally i ve been wanting to hang around with you and talk to you  then when i started admitting to myself that you re actually not so bad  i started finding myself wanting to reach out to you and to kiss you and touch you and just - to feel you   she could nt believe she was saying this but she could nt stop   james  she whispered  for him  that was it  he grabbed her by her waist and pushed her against the wall and kissed her again  this time it was hot and fierce  that s how lily liked it  she wanted to show james who she really was  that she was nt the innocent ginger girl everyone thought she was  his hands slid under her top to her sweaty stomach and touched her  he rubbed the sides of her waist  he extended his arms to her back and pulled her closer  then  he found the hem of her top and pulled it over her  he kissed lily on the corner of her mouth  then her cheek  he sucked and licked her sweaty  salty neck and kissed his way down her to her breasts and back up to her mouth  she felt james  hands all over her and it was euphoric  she too felt him  she grabbed onto his hard arms  kissed his stubbly jaw down to his neck  she moved her arms all over him  her favourite was his back  oh - his back  it was strong  muscly - she kissed him again -  james potter and lily evans  what is the meaning of this  do i need to send you to dumbledore s office   lily and james jumped apart  then james went in front of lily to hide her while she hastily put her top back on  when lily looked up  she found professor mcgonagall staring at them  her face turned scarlet  never had she been more embarrassed in her life   i thought i had told you to return to your floor and continue your duties  miss evans   she shouted   sorry  professor  that s my fault  james spoke  lily looked up   i told her to stay and keep me company  this wo nt happen again   lily stared at him   i do not care if you told her to jump in the lake  you were acting inappropriately instead of doing your head boy and girl duties  a further 50 points will be taken away from gryffindor  each  you ll be coming to detentions next saturday and sunday  i ll make sure to give you different times so this scene does nt repeat itself in my room  now go to bed   and they did nt have to be told twice  lily could nt even look at mcgonagall s face as she walked by out of her embarrassment  thank you so much for reading  i urge you to write a review or favourite the story if you liked it  it honestly does help  i was thinking if that if this story got to 5  favourites then i ll definitely write another one  i had the inspiration to write this story after i d read user greenconverses story  the incident in the library  you can see that there are parallels  but i could nt resist not writing something similar '],\n       dtype='<U119342'),\n array(['author s notes  okay  so  this is the 3rd story of the  tragic week   so far its  betrayal - 2 comedy - 1 mystery - 1 there  btw  this story happened during the yule ball  i thought i was running out of ideas for the 5th story  but then  during my physical ed class  good thing my friend helped me to think of something  oh well  song of inspiration  hero by enrique lglesias try listening to it while reading this  maybe -RRB- hero draco malfoy scowled as the pug-faced girl continued to tug the sleeves of his brand new 100-galleons worth dress robes  today was the dreaded yule ball  and just as his father had said  he ll have to escort the annoying parkinson to the said ball  he knew that his father had been trying his best to match them up  he could see his lame attempts over the summer  he rolled his eyes  glaring at the girl 2-head shorter than him   what    drakey dear  are nt we going to dance   she asked sweetly  fluttering her eyes at him in obvious flirtation  he mentally groaned   no   he replied flatly and suited himself to a chair just near the buffet table  pansy gave him a pout which she thought was cute  but in his part  was rather a disgusting site to see   oh well  you probably want me all by yourself without interruptions  eh   she smiled  her eyebrow rising suggestively  how thick can she get   yeah  that would be likely  listen pansy  i do nt like you  okay  so stop pushing yourself to me   he hissed  grabbing her shoulders roughly  pansy winced in pain  but nodded  draco stood up and looked for another seat  he found one  next to the flirting couple of the year  tun tun tun tun  hermione granger and viktor krum  of all the places  he sighed and sat down  he had to admit  granger had gone into a  somewhat  magical transformation  for someone who used to be a bushy bookworm  who turned into a very stunning princess in they eyes of everyone in the great hall  it was quite true that he fancied her too  funny as it may seem  but it all had started when she had slapped him  because of that  she had gained deep respect and admiration from draco malfoy   it s her-my-oh-nee   hermione smiled widely  teaching viktor how to say her name properly   her-my-own-ninny   he said  a slight triumphant look in his face   oh well  its close to it   his face faltered but instantly smiled at her  hermione smiled back  quite distracted  she could feel malfoy s eyes  who was just a table away from them  boring into her  she squirmed lightly under his gaze  which viktor took as a sign of discomfort   vould you like vumthin  to drink  her-my-own-ninny   he asked  hermione just nodded and watched him stand and leave their table  she turned sharply to malfoy  who was still staring at her  a light smirk in his face  she gave him a fierce questioning look  wrinkling her brows  and as if the world had gone insane  she froze after reading the words he mouthed to her   dance with me   she sat there  literally frozen at her seat  however  malfoy had already stood up and went to her side  he stood there  his head all high  and offered his hand to her   would you like to dance with me  milady   he asked in an unusual sweet voice  hermione  mesmerized by his steel orbs  did nothing but what her instincts told her to  she stood up and took his hand and let herself be dragged into the dance floor  there were some several gaps from the students after seeing who had arrived the dance floor to  well  dance  ron s ears had turned red and harry was quite shocked  a slow  peaceful music started playing  draco placed his arms on her waist and hermione tangled both of hers on his neck  she took a deep breath  and instantly warped herself back to reality   why   draco was quite lost in her that he barely heard her question  he could not believe it  the girl he liked  finally dancing with him  probably tonight  they would consider this as a truce  for the sake of  interhouse unity  as dumbledore had said   i ca nt see why not   his lips curved lightly  giving her a true small smile  hermione could nt help but smile back   but  i can  we re enemies   she said  stating the obvious  draco nodded in understanding   well  i m a boy  you re a girl  enemies or not  it s not against the laws   he smirked  hermione just rolled her eyes  and urged him to tell the truth  he ran a hand through his hair and took a big sigh   probably because i fancy you   he admitted  sighing  they continued to dance  following the soft rhythm of the music  hermione s eyes widened in disbelief   what    you heard what i said   no one had spoken after that small conversation  nonetheless  the feeling was unforgettable  as they swayed here and there  they could feel their hearts giving out a sudden strong beat  draco felt lightheaded and very  somehow  happy  he felt as if everything was so surreal and magnificent  and he just ca nt take his eyes off of the lovely girl he was dancing  he loved her  yes  and he could see it in her eyes  and that small shy smile that she was giving him  that she did too  her touch felt like electricity to him  an overwhelming spark  he could get lost in her lovely brown pools  which he was now staring at to   dra --  and the music came to an end   avada_kedavra   and as if the world had stopped  draco watched in horror as her eyes which were full of love awhile ago  slowly turn lifeless as the green jolt of light hit her back  her body slowly fell on the ground with a small thud as tears started to well up in his eyes   hermione   potter had shouted at the corner   run  he s here   suddenly  before draco even knew  he was surrounded by deatheaters  among them was his father  and in the middle  situated was voldemort  voldemort stepped forward to him  appreciation dancing in his eyes   congratulations  draco  i could expect nothing more of you  you distracted her  and now that the filthy mudblood is gone  harry potter wo nt stand a chance   how can the world be so unfair  end notes  that s for story three  haha  anyway  there  just some explanation  if you ever thought that draco was really just working on voldemort s orders  no would be the answer  he just really wanted to dance her  like an escape from reality even just for one night  but  sadly  reality had a way of finding them  -LRB-

rating  frm word count  5693 warnings  angst  character death  romance  au about some way into the first night back in ootp  disclaimer  i do nt own anything but the little story s idea  everything else belongs to who it belongs to  summary   that s right  granger  i saved your worthless  mudblood  life   avada_kedavra  it fills every pore of her being  and sticks to every thread of her clothing  it s in every breath she takes  and it hovers in the air around her  attempting to choke her  it nears and fades away  but always returns  a flash of green light  always missing her  but killing a part of herself all the same  the spells continue to miss her as she ducks and crouches  running for her life  but then always hit something  a fellow hogwarts student hoping to live through this horror  only to have their wish ignored as their body is blown back and made lifeless as it hits the muddy earth  she lost ron and harry the moment she d slipped into the trees of the forbidden forest -LRB- she and the other prefects had locked anyone third year and younger  and a few older years  in the common rooms before the attack could officially come  they re safe  she s sure -RRB-  at this point in time  she can only hope they re okay and keep going  keep running  keep ducking  keep living  a girl is screaming for help  as much as she wants to run  hermione pulls out her wand and takes off the way she needs to  so that she can help  she s too late though  and there s only a flash of green light and red hair flying subsequently though the air  hermione manages to keep her gasp of horror to herself at the sight of ginny weasley s dead body  she can see thestrals in the forest now  had she seen enough death for it to be apparent  she -LRB- ca nt do anymore -RRB- turns from the danger and runs away  she feels really bad for a moment about ginny and the possibility of ron finding his sister  but only for a moment  the feeling is fleeting and soon she s running for her own life again  she trips over seamus finnegan and backs away from lavender brown and wonders sarcastically if they believe voldemort s back now  she feels bad almost immediately after and ups whatever she d eaten just hours ago in the great hall  someone with robes of blue and bronze is lying spread eagle on the ground  hermione does nt stop to see who -- as far as she s concerned  it s some unnamed ravenclaw  she ca nt help them now  they re dead  how many were dead  how many had met avada_kedavra in these past five minutes alone  the screams told her  she did nt need an answer  there are no teachers  no one to protect them anymore  how can there be  the last hermione had seen of the professors  must have been when they were facing off against voldemort s death eaters  if any had managed to survive the wild casting of avada_kedavra  they were as on the run as the students  is it wrong for hermione to be supremely scared for her life  after all -LRB- as malfoy repeatedly like to remind her -RRB-  she was a mud blood  one of those few death eaters despised -- not to mention  well known as harry s friend  voldemort would know who she was and would very much want to kill her  she trips over a stray branch  but manages to continue her race to survive  avada_kedavra rings in her ears and green flashes of light reflect in her eyes  she screams as she s grabbed  until a hand covers her mouth and she is yanked around a large boulder  her back hits the jagged rocks harshly and she winces in pain  glaring at the person with the dark hood before her  she notices a bit of green lining  and the emblem on the front  a slytherin   i m only going to tell you once  you do nt say a word  and i wo nt kill you   the voice says  she wants to call the figure s bluff  but then she remembers that she dropped her wand in the scuffle and there had been a very distinctive crack  in short  she s quite screwed  the person removes their hood and she glares more  of course  it s draco malfoy  he somehow manages to show up at just the wrong time  every time  if there s chaos and a forest  there s malfoy  he takes his hand from her mouth slowly  and she immediately hisses   what the hell do you want   a hooded figure with a -LRB- death eater -RRB- mask walks by  shutting her up  he catches her wide-eyed look and nods   that s right  granger  i saved your worthless  mudblood  life   she glares  whispering   so what  i owe you now or something   he returns the glare wholeheartedly   i would nt want anything you could possibly give me    then why did you do it    i have my reasons    which are    not for you to know    oh  let me leave then  i d rather brave avada_kedavra   she sneers  attempting to pass malfoy and step back into the open   right  weasel s dead   he says   thought you d like to know  all four of them  potter s merlin knows where -- hopefully dying by voldemort s hand   she stops and turns to face him   you really are a right bastard   he grins at her   i beg to differ  mudblood  i told you at the end of fourth year  did nt i  i said that diggory was just the first  with the dark lord back  but would any of you do gooders listen   she s trembling  with what  she does nt know  it might be rage  it might by terror  all she knows is that there s an emotion she ca nt describe filling her entire being  she does nt really care for the emotion  whatever it is   so you feel smug now in being right  congratulations  malfoy   his face flushes a bit  tiny satisfaction for hermione  and he scowls   you d think so   a scream rings out in that moment and hermione jumps  she then remembers that she has no wand  that the forest is full of death eaters  and that she represents everything they re out to kill   and down goes another one   malfoy says  a bit monotonously   how long do you think this ll last   hermione s first shocked by his lack of sardonic tone  then by the civility of what he s said  she shrugs   until we re all dead  or until the ministry comes   she pauses  having not seen one slytherin through the entire ordeal   where are your friends    home  maybe  we all knew in advance and told the others  of course  but --   but you figured you d catch it all in action   hermione finishes knowingly   did you find it interesting entertainment   his eyes narrow   not nearly enough  you re still here   he tosses something at her suddenly  it glints in the moonlight and she catches it in surprise  looking down  a key  she begins to feel a weird pulling in her navel and sees draco pulling his hood back over his head and stepping back into the shadows as the forbidden forest disappears around her  her first thought is that draco malfoy just tricked her  handing her over on a silver platter to the death eaters  she realizes her error once she arrives in a dark alley  she steps out into the street lights and notices that she s been in the area before  the order of the phoenix  they were near by  suddenly filled with hope  she quickly races down the empty streets  her lungs burn as she gives herself no rest  every limb hurts  but she s determined to reach help first  she does nt know what she ll tell sirius or the others  bu -- she continues to run and finds herself between number eleven grimmauld place and number thirteen of the same  she lets out a slight sigh as number twelve comes into view  she runs forward  seeing sirius already opening the door  there s worry written on every line in his face at seeing her alone  she figures that by now  everyone knows of the attack  she does nt need to day anything  he already knows  which is a relief  as she passes out the moment she is over the threshold  - when she wakes up  some hours later  she finds out that harry won  he s in a coma and may never wake up  but what does any wizard care when he s the final victor  professor trelawney -- who she finds in the kitchen as one of those who escaped -- tells the order of the phoenix about her prophecy  there s no preamble  no act of mystery  hermione finds that she likes professor trelawney better when she s not pushing her second sight act  dumbledore later backs up trelawney s story  harry and voldemort were destined for a showdown such as what they had  and harry won  a fifteen year old boy  the price  many students dead and harry in a coma  sounds like a great cause to celebrate  does nt it  she remembers for months after what malfoy did  she s no where near proclaiming her undying love for him  but she does appreciate him saving her life  whatever reason he might ve had for it -LRB- harry s awake  and that adds to her good mood -RRB-  in the present s time  though  her parents are happy to see her later that day  as she knew they would be  mr and mrs weasley are considerably down  as hermione is the only one who managed to survive and escape safely  they ca nt really do anything about that now  though  can they  - nearly three years later  she graduates from a small wizarding school a few towns over from home and is top of her class  a month after  she receives an owl post -LRB- from a beautiful black owl she d never before seen in her life -RRB-  she s surprised to find an invitation and opens it carefully  and invitation  to a wedding  the wedding of draco malfoy and pansy parkinson  she has a moment  when thinking of the blond  but it flits away quickly  she decides to immediately rsvp  and tells him that  yes  he will see her there and that she s quite grateful for the invitation -LRB- even if that s stretching the truth -RRB-  she sits for a while and thinks on her life of the past seveneight years  her life s plan had been out the window for years  and she s just getting her own apartment  surprisingly  it does nt bother her so much anymore  - she runs into malfoy and parkinson at the leaky cauldron  she s leaving diagon alley with harry as the other couple gets ready to enter  parkinson smiles genuinely at her  compliments her hair and outfit  and tells how glad she is to have hermione and harry attending her wedding  hermione feels that same pang that she had at the sight of the invitation  it s only when her eyes reach malfoy s that she thinks it may be in connection to him  he acknowledges them and then practically drags pansy off and they disappear into the  shopping center   harry calls it weird  hermione calls it change  - the more she thinks about it  the more she feels that pang about draco s wedding  not that she knows what it is  not really  except some part of her does  a week after meeting at the leaky cauldron  pansy asks her out for drinks  hermione can therefore admit that change is in fact weird  she goes  of course  out of pure curiosity  they meet at the three broomsticks in hogsmead and pansy uses idle conversation until hermione asks for the point   i  well  that is to say --  hermione raises an eyebrow   i have no female friends to speak of  as you may have noticed    yes  and i do nt happen to be one of them    which explains my saying no female friends  does nt it   hermione glares and pansy returns it   so  you want me  to be your  maid of honor    in a way  yes   pansy returns  she then tells hermione that she d be the only one  so it would be perfectly alright to wear whatever dress robes she wants -LRB-  as long as they re light blue  -RRB-  she then tells hermione that there s an engagement party on friday night -LRB-  bring harry if you need to  -RRB- and to dress casual -LRB-  casual robes  hermione  but really nice ones  -RRB-  hermione wonders just what she s gotten herself into  - the engagement party is interesting  she keeps stealing glances at malfoy as he and pansy make friends and mingle  the question is still burning in the back of her mind and she needs to ask why  why on earth did he decide she was worth saving  why did he give her that port key  let her live  why was she so glad he d decided on saving her -LRB- and not in that  you saved my life  way  she s just happy he saved her -RRB-  rita skeeter s invited  of course she d be  she d never once hesitated to make sure the malfoy family looked well in the public s eye when they met the front cover of the daily prophet -LRB- or any other paper -RRB-  malfoy and harry shake hands  as they could have eight years ago  and bozo  rita s photographer  catches the moment  hermione only thinks for once -LRB- well thrice -RRB-  harry will look exceptionally well in rita s eyes  she thinks again about change  - draco works at the ministry  hermione did nt know that -LRB- and neither did harry -RRB-  and she s quite -LRB- pleasantly -RRB- surprised  when she asks  he explains of  the necessity of confiscating monetary things  and that the job is only compensation  he comes and goes as he pleases  she finds out that he s working towards one day being minister of magic  oddly  the thought of draco being in the seat of power is not hell for her  she figures it s better the devil she knows  she tells him she d vote for him  and flushes a bright red when he thanks her with a bemused smile  she s beginning to think she s gone inane  - pansy stops by her office one day  on the way to draco s -LRB- all this time  she s been assuming the woman had important business -RRB-  she invites hermione to lunch tomorrow and hermione agrees because she thinks they re beyond saying no  on their way out  draco acknowledges her with a  good afternoon   which she returns  smiling at the engaged couple  she has a flitting moment where she wonders what it would be like to walk around the wizarding world on the arm of draco malfoy  she pauses in thought and tells herself that it s probably exactly what it feels like the walk around the wizarding world on the arm of harry potter  she does nt actually believe that  not really  - draco invites her and harry to dinner a week later  she has a feeling that it s pansy s idea  but there s a tingle at the thought of spending the entire evening with him -LRB- why  she wo nt think of -RRB- that makes it all so exciting  she and harry have a fight over the invitation  he does nt want to go  she does  and they ca nt seem to agree  she goes alone  lying to pansy about why harry could nt come  when pansy goes to check on dinner  draco makes it very obvious that he does nt believe her or her story  she smiles and tells him that she could care less  there s this warm feeling she ca nt explain while looking at him  she wonders if he feels it too  - she tells him no  harry  he gets on one knee  at the yule ministry banquet  and asks her before every employee  and she sits there  staring down at him  when she does look up  it seems as if she magically finds draco and pansy a few tables away  a quick second of a locked gaze  and she finds herself realizing that she s drawn to draco  draco malfoy of all people  in the span of working together for six months  she s gotten something of a crush on him  perfect  she thinks disgustedly  looking back at harry at last  would it be right  marrying harry though she d never love him  pretending  living a lie  -LRB- no  -RRB- in a calm voice worthy of all notice  she says   no   the watching crowd beings to share a flurry of whispers  but she s only wondering what draco s thinking  if he now knows how she feels  it does nt even occur to her to think of what harry s reaction is  evidently  it s surprise   what    no   she sighs   i m sorry  harry  but i ca nt marry you   more whispers  she stands and walks away from harry  leaving the hall  she eventually finds her way to the snowy garden and flops onto the nearest bench  despite the cold  ten minutes later  someone sits beside her  she feels warm to realize it s draco  he does nt say anything to her  though  and that s okay  maybe it s better that they do nt talk  - the daily prophet is a joy to read the next morning  by the time it arrives  she s sitting down with her coffee  she rolls her eyes at the picture of her rejecting harry and considers the subtitle to be very rude and biased  classic rita skeeter  boredom leads to granger dumping war hero she groans  but flips it open and subjects herself to reading what s sure to be a very dismal article  hermione granger  one of very few survivors of the attack on hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry -- which also lead to the final battle between harry potter and lord voldemort  was well known to have been dating the infamous wizard once known as the boy who lived  harry potter  special correspondent rita skeeter saw first hand as potter knelt on one knee before granger and proposed  to the surprise of more than half the wizards present  she did nt even answer right away  she took a look around the room before telling potter a firm  calm   no  -LRB- see picture -RRB-  this however  does not end the story  many close friends of the two feel that there is more to the story than the public knows   she does nt talk about him much   says pansy parkinson -LRB- soon to be malfoy -RRB-   it may be because she saw them going downhill   also asked was co-worker and close friend  draco malfoy  but he left no real comment  only saying   i m not surprised she dumped potter  there s only excitement about him when something s trying to kill him  he s quite dull other than that   as others at the ministry say things along similar lines  it s no wonder granger felt as if she should cut her loses  this is rita skeeter  bringing you the best  hermione lets the paper fall in her toast and groans at the article  harry wo nt talk to her for weeks after an article like that  it was bad enough that he forced her to dump him in public  and pansy and draco s comments had nt helped any  she takes a sip of her coffee as an owl flies in  ron s owl  pig  mrs weasley had made him the family owl after ron  tied to his leg is a short roll of parchment and hermione starts as she has nt received a letter from the weasleys in a month or so  she takes it  pointing pig towards the bowl of owl treats and opening the message  she s kind of wary  the first time rita skeeter said anything about her and harry  mrs weasley had been cold to her  extremely  hermione  dear  i though i d get this out of the way  arthur and i care about both you and harry  and we do nt believe a word of rita skeeter s  we understand that it may not have been under fair circumstances  and that the heart works in very tricky ways  love  molly hermione lets out a relieved sigh at the contents of her message and sits back  it s a load off of her to know that there s no hard feelings -LRB- except from harry maybe -RRB- and she leaves the kitchen  ready for a day to visit her parents to celebrate the christmas holiday  of course  she ll visit the weasleys  later  awkward silences with harry or not  - her mother and father know about the break up  of course  she gave them a subscription to the daily prophet  but spent an hour explaining that boredom was not the reason for her dumping harry  it was a realization that she d had a lack of interest in him  they trade gifts  afterward  she spends a quiet dinner with the weasleys  it feels subdued  as it does every year  with only himself  harry  percy -LRB- he came to his senses and reconciled after fred  george  ginny and ron -RRB-  bill  charlie  mr and mrs weasley  harry does nt look in her direction and mrs weasley purposely gives her a large hug at her arrival  hermione can care less about his pettiness  the both should have realized they were nt working out months ago - she does nt continue the thought  instead focusing on having a good time  and being in good sheer these for the holidays  she does manage to corner him at midnight  when his is about to leave  it s a short conversation  and somewhat one-sided   listen  harry  you and i both know that rita skeeter is lying  you re my friend  and maybe it s not fair to you that i only love you as a friend  but you know what  we re not at all fooling anyone  and i do nt have time for you treating me as it i did something wrong   she feels oddly carefree and refreshed after that  - the return to work from her holiday off is refreshing  it s nice to be back where she can find peace and hide for most of the day behind a pile of paperwork and be able to just concentrate on that  at the end of the busiest day in months  she runs into draco on the elevator  for some reason  they re the only two to board  she checks her muggle watch -- it s six at night and she did nt even notice that she d worked herself over time   evening   she says  more to just say anything  and maybe to cover the tiny acceleration of her heart that only she can hear  it s draco s fault  though -LRB- and it is his fault that she now liked him  as far as hermione s concerned -RRB-  she looks straightforward at the door  nice door  it is   hermione   it s the first time she s ever heard her name fall from his lips and she falls in love with it instantly   good holiday   she grins   perfect   even the parts where she found out she was infatuated with draco malfoy and rejected her best friend because of it  he nods   good    thank you   she flounders for something else to say   so  er  did you -- how was your holiday    my mother visited   is his only answer  hermione does nt know whether that s good or bad and waits   she s happy to see pansy taking her duties seriously    duties   she echoes   lady of the manor   draco answers   ordering the house elves about  rearranging the décor to fit her   hermione blanks  wondering for a moment what it would be like to be the lady of malfoy manor  she concludes  watching draco out the corner of her eye  that it d be really  really nice  - pansy and draco s wedding looms ever near  harry still is nt talking to her  but it s okay because she s filled her time with finding out why draco saved her life nearly three years ago  she decides to ask him directly  instead of racking her brain for answers  and she does  ask  on another day where they re both running late and on the elevator after hours   draco  why did you save me that day   he looks at her and she gets that feeling that he really does nt want to answer   granger   she learned weeks ago that he switches between her first and last name   i just did  all right    i m sorry   she starts   but that s not good enough   he narrows his eyes at her   why is it so important to you    because  i --  is she really seconds away from revealing her romantic interest to draco malfoy   i  it just is  all right   as if he d seen something in her face  he s suddenly standing directly before her  giving her an utterly intense look  she returns it  unable to look away from the gray  she does nt notice that he s nearing her  nor does she question why  but she basks in it being so  her lips feel warm and tingle as his cover hers and she feels as if she s had fire whiskey  her stomach feels warm  right in the pit of her stomach  all too soon  it s over and she s watching him head towards the floo network on the ground floor  she wonders if this all means that pansy s just a fluke  - she owls her mother and tells her the dilemma  she s confused  and does nt know what to do  and she s so full of hope  she just might burst from it all  she then owls mrs weasley with the same problem  wanting advice from the two most important women in her life  oh  honey  it does sound like quite a dilemma  i m fairly sure though  that this draco may feel absolutely the same as you  after all  he did kiss you when you asked him why he saved you  do nt worry about harry or anyone else-especially not that rita skeeter-has to say  listen to your heart  hermione  do what you feel is right  love  mum hermione grins when she reads the first owl because she s received the ideal advice from someone who did nt know of the malfoys or what the family was rumored to have done  pig flies in soon after and she watches him zoom towards her owl treats as she opens the letter  hermione  dear  i m glad you trusted me with this  and  yes  my instincts may tell me that this is bad  but i mostly believe it will work itself out  draco malfoy or not  you were nt as happy as possible with harry  and if draco does this  i m behind you  love  molly hermione feels safe with their reassurance  as far as she s concerned  nothing can hurt her with them behind her  she s invincible -- her thoughts freeze as a third owl flies through the window  the malfoy owl  the letter is from pansy  requesting her attendance as the bachelorette party later that night  and remind her of the party and the wedding within the week  -- or not  she replies  saying she has to work late  - a week later  she s significantly wishing things were different  she d love an invention of the twins at the moment  she s dreading the party that comes the day before the wedding -LRB- in three days -RRB-  she falls into a depression three days before because it occurs to her that the man she wants is getting married  and she ll never know if it s just a phase  or if it can actually work  she calls in sick two days before the wedding and does nt leave her bed  not even for the daily prophet  as it sure enough advertises the event of the year  bill weasley and fleur delacour did nt even warrant this much publicity  the day before  at exactly midnight  hermione owls pansy  she s sick  not feeling very well  and she s afraid she may not be well enough for the wedding  some things have also come to her attention and she needs time to herself  by dawn  pansy replies to say that it s all right and that she understands  daphne greengrass already has a dress robe in the right shade just in case of this  hermione feels oddly about pansy s kindness  seeing as how she s pining after the other woman s husband to be  - hermione spends the day before and the day of the wedding crying for no real reason -LRB- after all  she is nt in love  she s just in very deep like -- at least  she thinks so -RRB-  actually  it s just the thought  all the thinking of what it d be like to be hermione granger malfoy  and the task easily falls to pansy for being a pureblood and a slytherin   bitch   hermione mutters darkly as she falls asleep  tears dried on her face  - she wakes up  feeling disgusting and dirty  surrounded by used tissues and the television remote  she reluctantly gets out of bed  sending her owl -LRB- she got him a few weeks ago and named him drake -- not one word -RRB- to the ministry with a note explaining that she s sick  the daily prophet comes in the middle of her subdued breakfast  and because she must be masochistic  she slowly opens it  waiting for the picture of draco and pansy in wedding robes  she does nt find this  she gapes  hope flaring deep within her  there s a picture of pansy alright  but she s sitting before the expensive hall where the wedding was scheduled  balling her eyes out as daphne greengrass rubs her back comfortingly  sense of duty brings second non-nuptial yesterday morning  writes special correspondent rita skeeter  pansy parkinson and daphne greengrass proceeded to ensure everything for the former s marriage to draco malfoy  high level ministry official and wizard aristocrat  little did anyone know  this wedding would not come to be  hermione s brain pauses in working  stopping completely  she ca nt believe that the wedding did nt happen  she returns to the article with great interest  selfish  of course -- but interest nonetheless  close friend  greengrass  later says that   draco never showed a real interest in marrying pansy  he only proposed because that is what we all expected him to do   surprisingly  many other guests also shared the same opinion  draco malfoy objected to the marriage before apparating from sight  his whereabouts are unknown at the moment  but his mother  narcissa malfoy  shows great concern for him   i do hope he s all right  i do nt blame him a bit  of course  never once did i think pansy was his type  there are certain others  that may fit better   it is therefore of the public s opinion that narcissa malfoy may actually know more about her con s very sudden decision to not marry pansy parkinson  we can only wait for the secret to come out  ca nt we  she drops the paper  almost knocking over a chair in her haste to get out of her seat  she runs to her room  putting on clothing and not bothering with any hygiene aspects  a grab of her wand -LRB- it had been a great moment to find out from draco  days after the attack  that it d only been a twig and that her wand was still intact -RRB-  a flick of her wrist  and a few muttered words later  she was disapparating from her apartment  her new surroundings were only trees  trees and more trees  she s in the forbidden forest  her instincts telling her that she would find draco here  she trudges forward  retracting steps from years past  until she reaches that familiar boulder and finds him leaning against it   i  i saw the paper   she says   really  front page  was it   draco asks   yes  actually  if it helps  pansy was put in the bad light   hermione replies   your mother  she said that pansy was nt your type  that  certain others  fit better   she tilts her head   what certain others   he looks up at her and she feels as if she should already know the answer  she frowns  did nt she already know the answer  had nt her own mother and molly weasley told her everything she needed to know  was nt it already obvious  he looks away then   you know  hermione    i think i may   she murmurs  stepping closer to him  he pushes himself off the boulder to face her  as if under some sort of imperio  she moves closer to him  until she actually feel his warm breath on her skin  even in the cool april air  yes  time had passed  she d had nine months of working with draco -- was it really all too surprising that she fell for him   that s good   draco agrees  as her face tilts up towards his  and as he leans down towards her   not good  draco  great   she whispers  her heart is beating wildly in her chest and she can only think that within seconds  his lips will be on hers  him reciprocating all her feelings was unexpected  yet completely welcome   you know -- my father would be rolling over in his grave   he whispers to her with a hint of a smile  pausing just before their kiss  she smiles confidently   let him roll   his lips cover hers and she smiles into the kiss  her arms finding their way around his neck as his wind around her waist  it s soft  sweet  passionate  eager  demanding  needful  wanton -- it s a complete paradox and absolutely perfect  it s better than being silent  better than imagining life as the next lady of the malfoy manor  it s better than knowing that it s highly likely that she will be the next lady of malfoy manor  it s indescribable  there s a flash of light  but she does nt really notice and she does nt think draco doe wither  no one will know about them until tomorrow morning  three women will smile  one boy who lived would be bitter and one stilted bride would be indignant  ministry officials find love after ending dead-end relationships special correspondent rita skeeter received the anonymous tip and has the scoop as she s seen an eye witness account on that oh-so-elusive reason narcissa malfoy may or may not have been hinting at only a day ago  hermione granger  ministry official and ex-romantic interest of harry potter  was seen in the forbidden forest with fellow co-worker  draco malfoy  reaching conclusions about obviously reciprocated feelings that they were harboring   i m not at all surprised   says molly weasley  as she s caught off guard at the ministry   hermione told me early on that she was feeling as if she may have a romantic interest in draco malfoy  i m just happy she s found love   also interviewed was muggle julia granger  who only had comments along similar lines   my daughter deserves happiness  i ll stand by her   most important was narcissa malfoy   i knew from the moment he went back to save her life nearly three years ago  i gave him the port key  actually  he saved her from my deceased husband  and got her out of danger  if we were set in our old ways  and not for making our world better and more solidified  i d make disapproving statements on the purity of her blood  but i ca nt seem to find it in myself to spout such parrot-like words   and there you have it  witches and wizards  i see wedding bells in the future  and they may actually ring this time  this is rita skeeter  the one and only that can bring you the top stories  finis ',\n        'twisted truths summary  caught in her web like every other victim  she loved to see them squirm  to beg for death  this one was nt  this one had something up his sleeve  wether it would work or not was up for debate  for the phobia challenge  monopoly game challenge  and the if you dare challenge  prompts  bellatrixgideon pairing from monopoly  algophobia from phobia  and beautiful madness -LRB- 864 -RRB- from dare  the sensation of falling is what snapped him from his sleeping state  looking down to only see a carpet below him in the empty house he had hidden in  those rugged lines becoming clearer as he drew near  with a whack his body hit the floor  the impact of it shuddering through him  gideon sucked in a breath  making the dust coil infront of him and get drawn in  he coughed it out knowing he had to move quickly or risk being killed by the death eater that had found him  whoever had found him   gideon   a familiar voice floated down the steps toward him   it rhymes with galleon   his eyes widened as her voice became louder   just how much are you worth  gideon  how much would i get if i were to exchange you   there was a clack of heels against the wood floor before the sound softened as she stepped onto the carpet he layed on  still desperately trying to catch his breath  get a hold of his bearings   what do you think  i would like a nice new dress   his eyes flitted around the room  taking everything in from what must have been how a mouse viewed the world  everything large in comparison to such a tiny creature  a black boot came into view  her steps finally stopping infront of him   you see   the words were drawn out  slowly as if they themselves could cause pain   my current dress is all covered in blood  the house elves do nt seem to realize what gentle wash means  they ll ruin it  just like the last one   he wondered vaguely if she was talking about him rather than a dress anymore   you going to answer my question   the toe of her boot poked his cheek  drawing him from his stupor  from the way a small point end sliced his cheek  gideon rolled away quickly and got up to face her  bellatrix  cloaked in a dark robe  her black curls twirling down to end just at the bottom of her breasts  it drew his gaze for a moment  there were specks of blood on her porcelain skin  if it was ever possible to ignore the fact that it was his companion s blood  that she was here to kill him  had killed others  tortured them  if that all went away he could actually say she was quite attractive in the tight bodice that he could see flashes of whenever the cloak moved due to the wind coming through an open window   your dress is nt dirtied bellatrix  it s just your cloak  you do nt need my worth   her lips curled up into an echo of a smile  it did nt reach her eyes  he was nt sure it could anymore   quite observant of you  i m also observant  you were leering at me gideon   her eyes flashed from the after light of lightning in the distance  it made him even more aware of the rain pounding relentlessly outside  perfect weather to travel under when you did nt want to get caught and were careful to not step in mud  now if he could just get out of sight   if you do nt want to be leered at i suggest a dress with a higher neckline so that bosom of yours is nt showing   he paused as a smirk fell across his face   maybe you do need my worth  to cover yourself up appropriately   by the sudden tense in her shoulders and the curl of her lip she had not missed the innuendo hidden in his words   worthless traitor   her scream was like that of a banshee  but her anger only made him grin wider  the fact that he was getting to her was funny  the fact that she was enraged  and that such a thing was dangerous was the only thing that made him holdback his response as she flew into a rage  eyes firmly latched on him  now that was rather thrilling  he could nt remember the last time he had a woman s full attenssion since he had to go on the run while the order tried to figure out a new secure base of operations   you blood-tratior  turning against your own and fighting for muggles of all things  you ve lost your very own respect the moment you went turncoat  and now because of it you re hiding in a place like this  some old hallowed out shell of a house  you ca nt hide from your traitorous deeds  and you have the indecency to say such things to me   her words echoed throughout the house as she swiftly stepped forward only to come to a stop as she resumed her screaming  merlin  those were high notes   i should let you know that i am a married woman  to a loyal pureblood   oh  that was even better  he had to surpress the approving noise in the back of his throat   you  dirty   oh  sooo good   filthy  blood-traitor   each word had been punctuated by the harsh click of her heels as she advanced toward him  eyes alight with fury   i ll see the light die from your eyes my self   her voice was bloody perfect   still a bit far away to see it go away are nt you   he questioned as her wand was raised toward him   there s no lights here  bella   he waved his hands dramatically to point the simple fact out even further  the brief highlight of the room from the lightning flooded his vision for a moment and he very briefly thought the ploy would nt work  that she would nt come closer   you only die once and i m not going to miss your death   the words were like music to his ears as she stepped so close that he could feel her breath against his face  he could feel the wand tip pressed against his throat  it was as perfect as a moment as he was going to get  gideon leaned forward swiftly  bringing his arm up and around to cradle the back of her neck as if she were a delicate doll  his lips met hers then and he could practically feel the anger surging beneath her skin  the rage that flowed through her very veins  it was such raw energy and as much as he wanted to turn it into something more useful he did nt have the time  he brought his tongue out to run across her soft lips before retracting quickly as to not get it bitten off as he felt her teeth already scraping at his lips while jerking her head back and out of his grip  it had been enough though  she fell back  literally on her rear to glare up at him  eyes that could cut glass  he let his smile form slowly   what was that before  about watching my life drain from my eyes  or something similar    i ll kill you   she screamed and her hand went back  to nothing  he smirked down at her  twirling her wand in his left hand absently   do nt you need this to do that   resting his pointer finger higher up and his thumb lower he stopped its motions   bella   he did nt care to hide the slight groan in his voice when he said her name and she visibly recoiled from the sound   it was so nice to see you again  but unfortunetly i have to get going  i hope you do nt mind if i take this with me   he tapped her wand with his fingers and it sent her into another rage   give my back my wand you theif  lowly trickster  coward  fleeing from death  you ll regret the day you were born   like that was possible  after having touched such soft sweet lips  it made him want to laugh   i ll torture you into insanity   his mind clicked slowly and he smiled at her   like you  insane like you  bella   lip twitching up his smile widened   just how much time do you think that would take  are nt you going to answer my question   he mocked  her hackles raised and she bolted from the ground in a screaming rage where not one word was intelligible  it was just pure fury  gideon twisted the wand to point directly at her   crucio   red light flew from the wand tip highlighting her face before it made contact  he felt his stomach twist sickeningly as her eyes widened and for the first time he saw fear in those eyes that had slowly become twisted since the first time they met  laughter filled the air as she was hit and thrown back to the ground  her body arching at what looked like an impossible angle  the sound filled his ears and he had to bite back a silent scream at the sounds she made now  it was nt joyous laughter  she was nt reveling in it like so many people thought she would if ever hit with the curse  it was crazed cackling that echoed hauntingly in his ears  it was a noise he rather not have to remember for the rest of his life  but it was there now  her body kept twisting on the floor and the flashes of lightning that illuminated her form in short bursts just made his skin crawl further  his wrist twitched but he kept it locked with the wand pointed at her as she howled louder  if he stopped now she would surely come after him again and he needed time and space to apparate away  his feet were already increasing the distance with each step he took while keeping his gaze on her  an arm jerked to the side and a shriek filled the air shortly followed by more of her laughter  another flash of lightning as he looked at her face and his blood boiled at the sight of her eyes rolling back into her head  voldemort had made her into this damn thing  his enemy  his jaw clentched and he only let out a soft growl when his back hit the wall  somehow she must have heard because her laughter increased as her body rolled into itself  there was another sharp pang in his stomach  she was scared of him  she was trying to get away from him   i ll kill them all for you   his words were soft but he was sure she heard them  first he would find her husband  then his associates  and he would gradually make his way to voldemort   see you later bells   with that last word he flicked the wand away from her and quickly cast the apparation spell so he could be anywhere but here '],\n       dtype='<U119342')]"
